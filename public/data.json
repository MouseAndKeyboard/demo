        "abstract": "As robots become increasingly complex, they must explain their behaviors to\ngain trust and acceptance. However, it may be difficult through verbal\nexplanation alone to fully convey information about past behavior, especially\nregarding objects no longer present due to robots' or humans' actions. Humans\noften try to physically mimic past movements to accompany verbal explanations.\nInspired by this human-human interaction, we describe the technical\nimplementation of a system for past behavior replay for robots in this tool\npaper. Specifically, we used Behavior Trees to encode and separate robot\nbehaviors, and schemaless MongoDB to structurally store and query the\nunderlying sensor data and joint control messages for future replay. Our\napproach generalizes to different types of replays, including both manipulation\nand navigation replay, and visual (i.e., augmented reality (AR)) and auditory\nreplay. Additionally, we briefly summarize a user study to further provide\nempirical evidence of its effectiveness and efficiency.

Here we address an exotic parity behavior\nof the QRM in its superradiant phase by numerical exact diagonalization,\nnamely, the parities of eigenstates of the QRM behave irregular in the strong\ncoupling regime but the sum of parities for each pair of eigenstates beginning\nfrom the ground state remains vanishing. It is found that this exotic behavior\noriginates from the comparability of the photon distribution in the odd and\neven components of Fock basis when the eigenenergies of each pair of\neigenstates approach enough to each other and physically is due to the emergent\ndouble-well potential induced by the strong coupling between the single-mode\nphoton field and the two-level atom. The result not only uncovers the physics\nnot known previously in the QRM but also makes an intrinsic limitation on the\nmeasurement precision of motional quantum states through parity measurements in\nmodern quantum science and technologies.",

Here, we thoroughly analyze a variety of modulation styles\nfor two-photon transitions, demonstrating the versatility of off-resonant\nmodulated driving protocols. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to refine\nthe designing process for improved performances for specific finite Rydberg\nblockade strength values. In particular, a reduced requirement on the blockade\nstrength can be directly linked to an improvement of connectivity in qubit\narray of neutral atoms. These progress are closely related to the core feature\nthat the atomic wave function acquires a geometric phase from the time\nevolution, which begins and finishes at the same quantum state. Under\nreasonable experimental conditions readily available nowadays, we anticipate\nthat the fidelity of such protocols can reach as high as the essential\nrequirement of NISQ even if the effects of technical errors and cold atoms'\nnonzero temperatures are considered.",

In\nthis paper, we propose an integrated proximal policy optimization model with\ndual-headway (IPPO-DH). IPPO-DH integrates the conventional headway control\nwith reinforcement learning, so that it acquires the advantages of both\nalgorithms -- it is more efficient in normal environments and more stable in\nharsh ones. To demonstrate such an advantage, we design a bus simulation\nenvironment and compare IPPO-DH with RL and several conventional methods.

        "abstract": "Explainability is becoming an increasingly important topic for deep neural\nnetworks. Though the operation in convolutional layers is easier to understand,\nprocessing becomes opaque in fully-connected layers. The basic idea in our work\nis that each instance, as it flows through the layers, causes a different\nactivation pattern in the hidden layers and in our Paths methodology, we\ncluster these activation vectors for each hidden layer and then see how the\nclusters in successive layers connect to one another as activation flows from\nthe input layer to the output. We find that instances of the same class follow\na small number of cluster sequences over the layers, which we name ``decision\npaths.\" Such paths explain how classification decisions are typically made, and\nalso help us determine outliers that follow unusual paths. We also propose\nusing the Sankey diagram to visualize such pathways. We validate our method\nwith experiments on two feed-forward networks trained on MNIST and CELEB data\nsets, and one recurrent network trained on PenDigits.",

A key signature of\nDST, highlighted in recent studies, is the very large fluctuations of the\nmeasured stress as the suspension thickens. A clear link between\nmicrostructural development and the dramatic increase of the stress\nfluctuations has not been established yet. To identify the microstructural\nunderpinnings of this behavior, we perform simulations of sheared dense\nsuspensions. By analyzing particle contact networks, we identify a subset of\nconstrained particles that contribute directly to the rapid rise in viscosity\nand the large stress fluctuations. Indeed, both phenomena can be explained by\nthe growth and percolation of constrained particle networks -- in direct\nanalogy to rigidity percolation. A finite size scaling analysis confirms this\nis a percolation phenomenon and allows us to estimate the critical exponents.\nOur findings reveal the specific microstructural transition that underlies DST.",

This can be due to the use of\nmicrophone arrays that emphasize horizontal spatial resolution or speaker\narrays that provide sparser coverage vertically. First, we review Ambisonic\nreproduction criteria, as defined by Gerzon, and summarize recent results on\nthe relative perceptual importance of the various criteria. Then we show that\nusing full-order decoders with mixed-order program material results in poorer\nperformance than with a properly designed mixed-order decoder. We then\nintroduce a new implementation of a decoder optimizer that draws upon\ntechniques from machine learning for quick and robust convergence, discuss the\nconstruction of the objective function, and apply it to the problem of\ndesigning two-band decoders for mixed-order signal sets and non-uniform\nloudspeaker layouts.

This\nreduced-physics approach produces solar wind flow simulations that closely\nemulate the flow produced by 3-D magnetohydrodynamic solar wind models at a\nsmall fraction of the computational expense. While not intended as a\nreplacement for 3-D MHD, the simplicity and computational efficiency of HUXt\noffers several key advantages that enable experiments and the use of techniques\nthat would otherwise be cost prohibitive. For example, large ensembles can\neasily be run with modest computing resources, which are useful for exploring\nand quantifying the uncertainty in space weather predictions, as well as for\nthe application of some data assimilation methods.\n  We present the developments in the latest version of HUXt, v4.0, and discuss\nour plans for future developments and applications of the model. The three key\ndevelopments in v4.0 are: a restructuring of the models solver to enable fully\ntime-dependent boundary conditions, such that HUXt can in principle be\ninitialised with in-situ observations from any of the fleet of heliospheric\nmonitors; new functionality to trace streaklines through the HUXt flow\nsolutions, which can be used to track features such as the Heliospheric Current\nSheet; introduction of a small test-suite so that we can better ensure the\nreliability and reproducibility of HUXt simulations for all users across future\nversions. Other more minor developments are discussed in the article.\n  Future applications of HUXt are discussed, including the development data\nassimilation schemes for assimilation of both remote sensing and in-situ plasma\nmeasures.

While VFL shows good\nperformance, practitioners often face uncertainty when preparing\nnon-transparent, internal\/external features and samples for the VFL training\nphase. Moreover, to balance the prediction accuracy and the resource\nconsumption of model inference, practitioners require to know which subset of\nprediction instances is genuinely needed to invoke the VFL model for inference.\nTo this end, we co-design the VFL modeling process by proposing an interactive\nreal-time visualization system, VFLens, to help practitioners with feature\nengineering, sample selection, and inference. A usage scenario, a quantitative\nexperiment, and expert feedback suggest that VFLens helps practitioners boost\nVFL efficiency at a lower cost with sufficient confidence.",

        "title": "Fast and Robust Video-Based Exercise Classification via Body Pose Tracking and Scalable Multivariate Time Series Classifiers",
        "abstract": "Technological advancements have spurred the usage of machine learning based\napplications in sports science. Physiotherapists, sports coaches and athletes\nactively look to incorporate the latest technologies in order to further\nimprove performance and avoid injuries. While wearable sensors are very\npopular, their use is hindered by constraints on battery power and sensor\ncalibration, especially for use cases which require multiple sensors to be\nplaced on the body. Hence, there is renewed interest in video-based data\ncapture and analysis for sports science. In this paper, we present the\napplication of classifying S\\&C exercises using video. We focus on the popular\nMilitary Press exercise, where the execution is captured with a video-camera\nusing a mobile device, such as a mobile phone, and the goal is to classify the\nexecution into different types. Since video recordings need a lot of storage\nand computation, this use case requires data reduction, while preserving the\nclassification accuracy and enabling fast prediction. To this end, we propose\nan approach named BodyMTS to turn video into time series by employing body pose\ntracking, followed by training and prediction using multivariate time series\nclassifiers. We analyze the accuracy and robustness of BodyMTS and show that it\nis robust to different types of noise caused by either video quality or pose\nestimation factors. We compare BodyMTS to state-of-the-art deep learning\nmethods which classify human activity directly from videos and show that\nBodyMTS achieves similar accuracy, but with reduced running time and model\nengineering effort. Finally, we discuss some of the practical aspects of\nemploying BodyMTS in this application in terms of accuracy and robustness under\nreduced data quality and size. We show that BodyMTS achieves an average\naccuracy of 87\\%, which is significantly higher than the accuracy of human\ndomain experts.",

        "abstract": "3D single object tracking is a key task in 3D computer vision. However, the\nsparsity of point clouds makes it difficult to compute the similarity and\nlocate the object, posing big challenges to the 3D tracker. Previous works\ntried to solve the problem and improved the tracking performance in some common\nscenarios, but they usually failed in some extreme sparse scenarios, such as\nfor tracking objects at long distances or partially occluded. To address the\nabove problems, in this letter, we propose a sparse-to-dense and\ntransformer-based framework for 3D single object tracking. First, we transform\nthe 3D sparse points into 3D pillars and then compress them into 2D BEV\nfeatures to have a dense representation. Then, we propose an attention-based\nencoder to achieve global similarity computation between template and search\nbranches, which could alleviate the influence of sparsity. Meanwhile, the\nencoder applies the attention on multi-scale features to compensate for the\nlack of information caused by the sparsity of point cloud and the single scale\nof features. Finally, we use set-prediction to track the object through a\ntwo-stage decoder which also utilizes attention. Extensive experiments show\nthat our method achieves very promising results on the KITTI and NuScenes\ndatasets.",

        "abstract": "Video object detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in computer\nvision. One practical solution is to take advantage of temporal information\nfrom the video and apply feature aggregation to enhance the object features in\neach frame. Though effective, those existing methods always suffer from low\ninference speeds because they use a fixed number of frames for feature\naggregation regardless of the input frame. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the inference speed of the current feature aggregation-based video\nobject detectors while maintaining their performance. To achieve this goal, we\npropose a vanilla dynamic aggregation module that adaptively selects the frames\nfor feature enhancement. Then, we extend the vanilla dynamic aggregation module\nto a more effective and reconfigurable deformable version. Finally, we\nintroduce inplace distillation loss to improve the representations of objects\naggregated with fewer frames. Extensive experimental results validate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods: On the ImageNet VID\nbenchmark, integrated with our proposed methods, FGFA and SELSA can improve the\ninference speed by 31% and 76% respectively while getting comparable\nperformance on accuracy.",

        "title": "Throwing Objects into A Moving Basket While Avoiding Obstacles",
        "abstract": "The capabilities of a robot will be increased significantly by exploiting\nthrowing behavior. In particular, throwing will enable robots to rapidly place\nthe object into the target basket, located outside its feasible kinematic\nspace, without traveling to the desired location. In previous approaches, the\nrobot often learned a parameterized throwing kernel through analytical\napproaches, imitation learning, or hand-coding. There are many situations in\nwhich such approaches do not work\/generalize well due to various object shapes,\nheterogeneous mass distribution, and also obstacles that might be presented in\nthe environment. It is obvious that a method is needed to modulate the throwing\nkernel through its meta parameters. In this paper, we tackle object throwing\nproblem through a deep reinforcement learning approach that enables robots to\nprecisely throw objects into moving baskets while there are obstacles\nobstructing the path. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group that\naddresses throwing objects with obstacle avoidance. Such a throwing skill not\nonly increases the physical reachability of a robot arm but also improves the\nexecution time. In particular, the robot detects the pose of the target object,\nbasket, and obstacle at each time step, predicts the proper grasp configuration\nfor the target object, and then infers appropriate parameters to throw the\nobject into the basket. Due to safety constraints, we develop a simulation\nenvironment in Gazebo to train the robot and then use the learned policy in\nreal-robot directly. To assess the performers of the proposed approach, we\nperform extensive sets of experiments in both simulation and real robots in\nthree scenarios. Experimental results showed that the robot could precisely\nthrow a target object into the basket outside its kinematic range and\ngeneralize well to new locations and objects without colliding with obstacles.",

In this paper, we show how this approach can\nbe extended to almost all known 2D~lattices, and propose a systematic way of\ndesigning LL even for higher dimension. We demonstrate in detail how this LL\ntheory works and predicts accurately not only the location, but also the\nenergies of localized eigenfunctions in the low and high energy regimes for the\nhoneycomb and hexagonal lattices, making it a highly promising tool for\ninvestigating the role of disorder in these materials.",

When assets are allocated in discrete units, this is a\ncombinatorial optimization problem that can be addressed by quantum and\nquantum-inspired algorithms. In this work we present an integer simulated\nannealing method to find optimal portfolios in the presence of discretized\nconvex and non-convex cost functions. Our algorithm can deal with large size\nportfolios with hundreds of assets. We introduce a performance metric, the time\nto target, based on a lower bound to the cost function obtained with the\ncontinuous relaxation of the combinatorial optimization problem. This metric\nallows us to quantify the time required to achieve a solution with a given\nquality. We carry out numerical experiments and we benchmark the algorithm in\ntwo situations: (i) Monte Carlo instances are started at random, and (ii) the\nalgorithm is warm-started with an initial instance close to the continuous\nrelaxation of the problem. We find that in the case of warm-starting with\nconvex cost functions, the time to target does not grow with the size of the\noptimization problem, so discretized versions of convex portfolio optimization\nproblems are not hard to solve using classical resources. We have applied our\nmethod to the problem of re-balancing in the presence of non-convex transaction\ncosts, and we have found that our algorithm can efficiently minimize those\nterms.",

This work addresses lightweight\nVPR by proposing a novel system based on the combination of binary-weighted\nclassifier networks with a one-dimensional convolutional network, dubbed\nmerger. Recent work in fusing multiple VPR techniques has mainly focused on\nincreasing VPR performance, with computational efficiency not being highly\nprioritized. In contrast, we design our technique prioritizing low inference\ntimes, taking inspiration from the machine learning literature where the\nefficient combination of classifiers is a heavily researched topic. Our\nexperiments show that the merger achieves inference times as low as 1\nmillisecond, being significantly faster than other well-established lightweight\nVPR techniques, while achieving comparable or superior VPR performance on\nseveral visual changes such as seasonal variations and viewpoint lateral\nshifts.",

In such contexts, the\nreliability of user texts is often compromised by behavioural and emotional\ndimensions. To this end, several attempts have been made in the state of the\nart, to introduce psychological approaches in such systems, including\ncomputational psycholinguistics, personality traits and cognitive psychology\nmethods.\n  In contrast, our method is fundamentally different since we employ a\npsychoanalysis-based approach; in particular, we use the notion of Lacanian\ndiscourse types, to capture and deeply understand real (possibly elusive)\ncharacteristics, qualities and contents of texts, and evaluate their\nreliability. As far as we know, this is the first time computational methods\nare systematically combined with psychoanalysis. We believe such psychoanalytic\nframework is fundamentally more effective than standard methods, since it\naddresses deeper, quite primitive elements of human personality, behaviour and\nexpression which usually escape methods functioning at \"higher\", conscious\nlayers. In fact, this research is a first attempt to form a new paradigm of\npsychoanalysis-driven interactive technologies, with broader impact and diverse\napplications.\n  To exemplify this generic approach, we apply it to the case-study of fake\nnews detection; we first demonstrate certain limitations of the well-known\nMyers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality type method, and then propose\nand evaluate our new method of analysing user texts and detecting fake news\nbased on the Lacanian discourses psychoanalytic approach.",

        "abstract": "Vision-based autonomous navigation systems rely on fast and accurate object\ndetection algorithms to avoid obstacles. Algorithms and sensors designed for\nsuch systems need to be computationally efficient, due to the limited energy of\nthe hardware used for deployment. Biologically inspired event cameras are a\ngood candidate as a vision sensor for such systems due to their speed, energy\nefficiency, and robustness to varying lighting conditions. However, traditional\ncomputer vision algorithms fail to work on event-based outputs, as they lack\nphotometric features such as light intensity and texture. In this work, we\npropose a novel technique that utilizes the temporal information inherently\npresent in the events to efficiently detect moving objects. Our technique\nconsists of a lightweight spiking neural architecture that is able to separate\nevents based on the speed of the corresponding objects. These separated events\nare then further grouped spatially to determine object boundaries. This method\nof object detection is both asynchronous and robust to camera noise. In\naddition, it shows good performance in scenarios with events generated by\nstatic objects in the background, where existing event-based algorithms fail.\nWe show that by utilizing our architecture, autonomous navigation systems can\nhave minimal latency and energy overheads for performing object detection.",

        "abstract": "Context has been an important topic in recommender systems over the past two\ndecades. A standard representational approach to context assumes that\ncontextual variables and their structures are known in an application. Most of\nthe prior CARS papers following representational approach manually selected and\nconsidered only a few crucial contextual variables in an application, such as\ntime, location, and company of a person. This prior work demonstrated\nsignificant recommendation performance improvements when various CARS-based\nmethods have been deployed in numerous applications. However, some recommender\nsystems applications deal with a much bigger and broader types of contexts, and\nmanually identifying and capturing a few contextual variables is not sufficient\nin such cases. In this paper, we study such ``context-rich'' applications\ndealing with a large variety of different types of contexts. We demonstrate\nthat supporting only a few most important contextual variables, although\nuseful, is not sufficient. In our study, we focus on the application that\nrecommends various banking products to commercial customers within the context\nof dialogues initiated by customer service representatives. In this\napplication, we managed to identify over two hundred types of contextual\nvariables. Sorting those variables by their importance forms the Long Tail of\nContext (LTC). In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that LTC matters and\nusing all these contextual variables from the Long Tail leads to significant\nimprovements in recommendation performance.",

This leaves a gap in our understanding of\nreactive control, where and how to design direct interventions, and what such\ncontrol strategies may teach us about existing structures and dynamics. Here we\nstudy reactive control of coupled oscillator networks and demonstrate dual\ncontrol strategies that may be implemented interchangeably to achieve\nsynchronization. These differing strategies take advantage of different network\nproperties, the first directly targeting oscillator that are difficult to\nentrain, and the second targeting oscillators with strong influence on others.\nThus, in addition to enlarge strategies for network control, the different\ncontrol sets shed light on the oscillators dynamical and structural roles\nwithin the system.

In this work, we propose a data-centric approach to dynamic\nmanipulation that uses an often ignored source of information: sound. We first\ncollect a dataset of 25k interaction-sound pairs across five dynamic tasks\nusing commodity contact microphones. Then, given this data, we leverage\nself-supervised learning to accelerate behavior prediction from sound. Our\nexperiments indicate that this self-supervised 'pretraining' is crucial to\nachieving high performance, with a 34.5% lower MSE than plain supervised\nlearning and a 54.3% lower MSE over visual training. Importantly, we find that\nwhen asked to generate desired sound profiles, online rollouts of our models on\na UR10 robot can produce dynamic behavior that achieves an average of 11.5%\nimprovement over supervised learning on audio similarity metrics.",

        "abstract": "Neural networks are configured by choosing an architecture and hyperparameter\nvalues; doing so often involves expert intuition and hand-tuning to find a\nconfiguration that extrapolates well without overfitting. This paper considers\nautomatic methods for configuring a neural network that extrapolates in time\nfor the domain of visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy. In particular,\nwe study the effect of (a) selecting samples for validating configurations and\n(b) using ensembles.\n  Most of the time, models are built of the past to predict the future. To\nencourage the neural network model to extrapolate, we consider validating model\nconfigurations on samples that are shifted in time similar to the test set. We\nexperiment with three validation set choices: (1) a random sample of 1\/3 of\nnon-test data (the technique used in previous work), (2) using the latest 1\/3\n(sorted by time), and (3) using a semantically meaningful subset of the data.\nHyperparameter optimization relies on the validation set to estimate test-set\nerror, but neural network variance obfuscates the true error value. Ensemble\naveraging - computing the average across many neural networks - can reduce the\nvariance of prediction errors.\n  To test these methods, we do a comprehensive study of a held-out 2018 harvest\nseason of mango fruit given VNIR spectra from 3 prior years. We find that\nensembling improves the state-of-the-art model's variance and accuracy.\nFurthermore, hyperparameter optimization experiments - with and without\nensemble averaging and with each validation set choice - show that when\nensembling is combined with using the latest 1\/3 of samples as the validation\nset, a neural network configuration is found automatically that is on par with\nthe state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Temporal graph is an abstraction for modeling dynamic systems that consist of\nevolving interaction elements. In this paper, we aim to solve an important yet\nneglected problem -- how to learn information from high-order neighbors in\ntemporal graphs? -- to enhance the informativeness and discriminativeness for\nthe learned node representations. We argue that when learning high-order\ninformation from temporal graphs, we encounter two challenges, i.e.,\ncomputational inefficiency and over-smoothing, that cannot be solved by\nconventional techniques applied on static graphs. To remedy these deficiencies,\nwe propose a temporal propagation-based graph neural network, namely TPGNN. To\nbe specific, the model consists of two distinct components, i.e., propagator\nand node-wise encoder. The propagator is leveraged to propagate messages from\nthe anchor node to its temporal neighbors within $k$-hop, and then\nsimultaneously update the state of neighborhoods, which enables efficient\ncomputation, especially for a deep model. In addition, to prevent\nover-smoothing, the model compels the messages from $n$-hop neighbors to update\nthe $n$-hop memory vector preserved on the anchor. The node-wise encoder adopts\ntransformer architecture to learn node representations by explicitly learning\nthe importance of memory vectors preserved on the node itself, that is,\nimplicitly modeling the importance of messages from neighbors at different\nlayers, thus mitigating the over-smoothing. Since the encoding process will not\nquery temporal neighbors, we can dramatically save time consumption in\ninference. Extensive experiments on temporal link prediction and node\nclassification demonstrate the superiority of TPGNN over state-of-the-art\nbaselines in efficiency and robustness.",

The framework consists in dividing the network\ninto sectors of influence, and then selecting the most influential nodes within\nthese sectors. We explore three different methodologies to find sectors in a\nnetwork: graph partitioning, graph hyperbolic embedding, and community\nstructure. The framework is validated with a systematic analysis of real and\nsynthetic networks. We show that the gain in performance generated by dividing\na network into sectors before selecting the influential spreaders increases as\nthe modularity and heterogeneity of the network increase. Also, we show that\nthe division of the network into sectors can be efficiently performed in a time\nthat scales linearly with the network size, thus making the framework\napplicable to large-scale influence maximization problems.",

        "abstract": "Visual imitation learning provides an effective framework to learn skills\nfrom demonstrations. However, the quality of the provided demonstrations\nusually significantly affects the ability of an agent to acquire desired\nskills. Therefore, the standard visual imitation learning assumes near-optimal\ndemonstrations, which are expensive or sometimes prohibitive to collect.\nPrevious works propose to learn from noisy demonstrations; however, the noise\nis usually assumed to follow a context-independent distribution such as a\nuniform or gaussian distribution. In this paper, we consider another crucial\nyet underexplored setting -- imitation learning with task-irrelevant yet\nlocally consistent segments in the demonstrations (e.g., wiping sweat while\ncutting potatoes in a cooking tutorial). We argue that such noise is common in\nreal world data and term them \"extraneous\" segments. To tackle this problem, we\nintroduce Extraneousness-Aware Imitation Learning (EIL), a self-supervised\napproach that learns visuomotor policies from third-person demonstrations with\nextraneous subsequences. EIL learns action-conditioned observation embeddings\nin a self-supervised manner and retrieves task-relevant observations across\nvisual demonstrations while excluding the extraneous ones. Experimental results\nshow that EIL outperforms strong baselines and achieves comparable policies to\nthose trained with perfect demonstration on both simulated and real-world robot\ncontrol tasks.

        "abstract": "Optimizing strategic decisions (a.k.a. computing equilibrium) is key to the\nsuccess of many non-cooperative multi-agent applications. However, in many\nreal-world situations, we may face the exact opposite of this game-theoretic\nproblem -- instead of prescribing equilibrium of a given game, we may directly\nobserve the agents' equilibrium behaviors but want to infer the underlying\nparameters of an unknown game. This research question, also known as inverse\ngame theory, has been studied in multiple recent works in the context of\nStackelberg games. Unfortunately, existing works exhibit quite negative\nresults, showing statistical hardness and computational hardness, assuming\nfollower's perfectly rational behaviors. Our work relaxes the perfect\nrationality agent assumption to the classic quantal response model, a more\nrealistic behavior model of bounded rationality. Interestingly, we show that\nthe smooth property brought by such bounded rationality model actually leads to\nprovably more efficient learning of the follower utility parameters in general\nStackelberg games. Systematic empirical experiments on synthesized games\nconfirm our theoretical results and further suggest its robustness beyond the\nstrict quantal response model.",

However, these models often display long training times and\nsuboptimal results, especially for longer duration data. While a common\nstrategy in the literature imposes strong constraints to the NeuralODE\narchitecture to inherently promote stable model dynamics, such methods are\nill-suited for dynamics discovery as the unknown governing equation is not\nguaranteed to satisfy the assumed constraints. In this paper, we develop a new\ntraining method for NeuralODEs, based on synchronization and homotopy\noptimization, that does not require changes to the model architecture. We show\nthat synchronizing the model dynamics and the training data tames the\noriginally irregular loss landscape, which homotopy optimization can then\nleverage to enhance training. Through benchmark experiments, we demonstrate our\nmethod achieves competitive or better training loss while often requiring less\nthan half the number of training epochs compared to other model-agnostic\ntechniques. Furthermore, models trained with our method display better\nextrapolation capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.",

We develop a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm\ncalled Adaptive Activator RL (AARL), which determines the subset of mmWave\nlinks that should be activated during each time slot and the power level for\neach link. The most important property of AARL is its ability to make\nscheduling decisions within the strict time slot constraints of typical 5G\nmmWave networks. AARL can handle a variety of network topologies, network\nloads, and interference models, it can also adapt to different workloads. We\ndemonstrate the operation of AARL on several topologies: a small topology with\n10 links, a moderately-sized mesh with 48 links, and a large topology with 96\nlinks. We show that for each topology, we compare the throughput obtained by\nAARL to that of a benchmark algorithm called RPMA (Residual Profit Maximizer\nAlgorithm). The most important advantage of AARL compared to RPMA is that it is\nmuch faster and can make the necessary scheduling decisions very rapidly during\nevery time slot, while RPMA cannot. In addition, the quality of the scheduling\ndecisions made by AARL outperforms those made by RPMA.",

However, even with a Bayesian\ndynamic borrowing which can discount the historical data based on the outcome\nsimilarity of the two populations, a considerable population difference may\nstill lead to a moderate bias.

Based on the derived transformation\nrules, we propose the design of multilayered structures with spatially varying\ncell depth, instead of engineering the rank-2 shear viscosity tensor, to\nrealize the required anisotropy of transformation Hele-Shaw hydrodynamic\nmetamaterials. The theoretical certify and fabrication method revealed in this\nwork may pave an avenue for precisely controlling flow distribution with the\nconcept of artificial structure design.",

        "abstract": "Detecting anomalies over real-world datasets remains a challenging task. Data\nannotation is an intensive human labor problem, particularly in sequential\ndatasets, where the start and end time of anomalies are not known. As a result,\ndata collected from sequential real-world processes can be largely unlabeled or\ncontain inaccurate labels. These characteristics challenge the application of\nanomaly detection techniques based on supervised learning. In contrast,\nMultiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been shown effective on problems with\nincomplete knowledge of labels in the training dataset, mainly due to the\nnotion of bags. While largely under-leveraged for anomaly detection, MIL\nprovides an appealing formulation for anomaly detection over real-world\ndatasets, and it is the primary contribution of this paper. In this paper, we\npropose an MIL-based formulation and various algorithmic instantiations of this\nframework based on different design decisions for key components of the\nframework. We evaluate the resulting algorithms over four datasets that capture\ndifferent physical processes along different modalities. The experimental\nevaluation draws out several observations. The MIL-based formulation performs\nno worse than single instance learning on easy to moderate datasets and\noutperforms single-instance learning on more challenging datasets.

        "abstract": "Methods utilizing instrumental variables have been a fundamental statistical\napproach to estimation in the presence of unmeasured confounding, usually\noccurring in non-randomized observational data common to fields such as\neconomics and public health. However, such methods usually make constricting\nlinearity and additivity assumptions that are inapplicable to the complex\nmodeling challenges of today. The growing body of observational data being\ncollected will necessitate flexible regression modeling while also being able\nto control for confounding using instrumental variables. Therefore, this\narticle presents a nonlinear instrumental variable regression model based on\nBayesian regression tree ensembles to estimate such relationships, including\ninteractions, in the presence of confounding. One exciting application of this\nmethod is to use genetic variants as instruments, known as Mendelian\nrandomization. Body mass index is one factor that is hypothesized to have a\nnonlinear relationship with cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure\nwhile interacting with age. Heterogeneity in patient characteristics such as\nage could be clinically interesting from a precision medicine perspective where\nindividualized treatment is emphasized.

Therefore, in this\npaper, we systematically study the synergy between wavelet transform and\nTransformers. We propose Wavelet Space Attention (WavSpA) that facilitates\nattention learning in a learnable wavelet coefficient space which replaces the\nattention in Transformers by (1) applying forward wavelet transform to project\nthe input sequences to multi-resolution bases, (2) conducting attention\nlearning in the wavelet coefficient space, and (3) reconstructing the\nrepresentation in input space via backward wavelet transform. Extensive\nexperiments on the Long Range Arena demonstrate that learning attention in the\nwavelet space using either fixed or adaptive wavelets can consistently improve\nTransformer's performance and also significantly outperform learning in Fourier\nspace.

Dynamic 3D object tracking has then\nbecome a significant capability in visual SLAM with the requirement of\nunderstanding dynamic surroundings in various scenarios including autonomous\ndriving, augmented and virtual reality. However, performing dynamic SLAM solely\nwith monocular images remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of\nassociating dynamic features and estimating their positions. In this paper, we\npresent MOTSLAM, a dynamic visual SLAM system with the monocular configuration\nthat tracks both poses and bounding boxes of dynamic objects. MOTSLAM first\nperforms multiple object tracking (MOT) with associated both 2D and 3D bounding\nbox detection to create initial 3D objects. Then, neural-network-based\nmonocular depth estimation is applied to fetch the depth of dynamic features.\nFinally, camera poses, object poses, and both static, as well as dynamic map\npoints, are jointly optimized using a novel bundle adjustment. Our experiments\non the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our system has reached best performance\non both camera ego-motion and object tracking on monocular dynamic SLAM.",

        "abstract": "We present the development of SIR-HUXt, the integration of a sequential\nimportance resampling (SIR) data assimilation scheme with the HUXt solar wind\nmodel. SIR-HUXt is designed to assimilate the time-elongation profiles of CME\nfronts in the low heliosphere, such as those typically extracted from\nheliospheric imager data returned by the STEREO, Parker Solar Probe, and Solar\nOrbiter missions. We use Observing System Simulation Experiments to explore the\nperformance of SIR-HUXt for a simple synthetic CME scenario of a fully Earth\ndirected CME flowing through a uniform ambient solar wind, where the CME is\ninitialised with the average observed CME speed and width. These experiments\nare performed for a range of observer locations, from 20 deg to 90 deg behind\nEarth, spanning the L5 point where ESA's future Vigil space weather monitor\nwill return heliospheric imager data for operational space weather forecasting.\n  We show that SIR-HUXt performs well at constraining the CME speed, and has\nsome success at constraining the CME longitude. The CME width is largely\nunconstrained by the SIR-HUXt assimilations, and more experiments are required\nto determine if this is due to this specific CME scenario, or is a general\nfeature of assimilating time-elongation profiles. Rank-histograms suggest that\nthe SIR-HUXt ensembles are well calibrated, with no clear indications of bias\nor under\/over dispersion. Improved constraints on the initial CME speed lead\ndirectly to improvements in the CME transit time to Earth and arrival speed.\nFor an observer in the L5 region, SIR-HUXt returned a 69% reduction in the CME\ntransit time uncertainty, and a 63% reduction in the arrival speed uncertainty.\nThis suggests SIR-HUXt has potential to improve the real-world representivity\nof HUXt simulations, and therefore has potential to reduce the uncertainty of\nCME arrival time hindcasts and forecasts.",

Within the CERN\nEP R&D programme and the AIDAinnova collaboration, innovative hybridisation\nconcepts targeting vertex-detector applications at future colliders are under\ndevelopment. Recent results of two novel interconnect methods for pixel pitches\nof 25um and 55um are presented in this contribution -- an industrial fine-pitch\nSnAg solder bump-bonding process adapted to single-die processing using support\nwafers, as well as a newly developed in-house single-die interconnection\nprocess based on ACF.\n  The fine-pitch bump-bonding process is qualified with hybrid assemblies from\na recent bonding campaign at Frauenhofer IZM. Individual CLICpix2 ASICs with\n25um pixel pitch were bump-bonded to active-edge silicon sensors with\nthicknesses ranging from 50um to 130um. The device characterisation was\nconducted in the laboratory as well as during a beam test campaign at the CERN\nSPS beam-line, demonstrating an interconnect yield of about 99.7%.\n  The ACF interconnect technology replaces the solder bumps by conductive\nmicro-particles embedded in an epoxy film. The electro-mechanical connection\nbetween the sensor and ASIC is achieved via thermocompression of the ACF using\na flip-chip device bonder. The required pixel pad topology is achieved with an\nin-house ENIG plating process. This newly developed ACF hybridisation process\nis first qualified with the Timepix3 ASICs and sensors with 55um pixel pitch.\nThe technology can be also used for ASIC-PCB\/FPC integration, replacing wire\nbonding or large-pitch solder bumping techniques.",

To verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed Neuro-Planner, we carry out detailed comparison\nexperiments with various SNN training algorithm (STBP, BPTT and SLAYER) in the\nsoftware-in-the-loop (SITL) simulation framework. The navigation success rate\nof our HDDPG-STBP is 4.3\\% and 5.3\\% higher than that of the original DDPG in\nthe two evaluation environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work combining neuromorphic computing and deep reinforcement learning for\nMAV 3D visual navigation task.",

        "abstract": "Physical layer key generation (PLKG) is a promising technology to obtain\nsymmetric keys between a pair of wireless communication users in a\nplug-and-play manner. The shared entropy source almost entirely comes from the\nintrinsic randomness of the radio channel, which is highly dependent on the\nwireless environments. However, in some static\/block fading wireless\nenvironments, the intrinsic randomness of the wireless channel is hard to be\nguaranteed. Very recently, thanks to reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)\nwith their excellent ability on electromagnetic wave control, the wireless\nchannel environment can be customized. In this article, we overview the\nRISaided PLKG in static indoor environments, including its channel model and\nhardware architectures. Then, we propose potential application scenarios and\nanalyze the design challenges of RIS aided PLKG, including channel reciprocity,\nRIS reconfiguration speed and RIS deployment via proof-of-concept experiments\non a RIS-aided PLKG prototype system. In particular, our experimental results\nshow that the key generation rate is 15-fold higher than that without RIS in a\nstatic indoor environment. Next, we design a RIS jamming attack via a prototype\nexperiment and discuss its possible attack-defense countermeasures. Finally,\nseveral conclusions and future directions are identified.",

The trained model qualitatively captures the filamentary structure of\nclustered particles in a highly non-linear regime. We assess model fidelity by\ncalculating metrics of the density field (the radial distribution function) and\nof the velocity field (the relative velocity and the relative radial velocity\nbetween particles).

Today, machine learning algorithms,\nsometimes trained on alternative data, are increasingly being used to determine\naccess to credit, yet research has shown that machine learning can encode many\ndifferent versions of \"unfairness,\" thus raising the concern that banks and\nother financial institutions could -- potentially unwittingly -- engage in\nillegal discrimination through the use of this technology. In the US, there are\nlaws in place to make sure discrimination does not happen in lending and\nagencies charged with enforcing them. However, conversations around fair credit\nmodels in computer science and in policy are often misaligned: fair machine\nlearning research often lacks legal and practical considerations specific to\nexisting fair lending policy, and regulators have yet to issue new guidance on\nhow, if at all, credit risk models should be utilizing practices and techniques\nfrom the research community. This paper aims to better align these sides of the\nconversation. We describe the current state of credit discrimination regulation\nin the United States, contextualize results from fair ML research to identify\nthe specific fairness concerns raised by the use of machine learning in\nlending, and discuss regulatory opportunities to address these concerns.",

        "title": "Toward Knowledge-Driven Speech-Based Models of Depression: Leveraging Spectrotemporal Variations in Speech Vowels",
        "abstract": "Psychomotor retardation associated with depression has been linked with\ntangible differences in vowel production. This paper investigates a\nknowledge-driven machine learning (ML) method that integrates spectrotemporal\ninformation of speech at the vowel-level to identify the depression. Low-level\nspeech descriptors are learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is\ntrained for vowel classification. The temporal evolution of those low-level\ndescriptors is modeled at the high-level within and across utterances via a\nlong short-term memory (LSTM) model that takes the final depression decision. A\nmodified version of the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)\nis further used to identify the impact of the low-level spectrotemporal vowel\nvariation on the decisions and observe the high-level temporal change of the\ndepression likelihood. The proposed method outperforms baselines that model the\nspectrotemporal information in speech without integrating the vowel-based\ninformation, as well as ML models trained with conventional prosodic and\nspectrotemporal features. The conducted explainability analysis indicates that\nspectrotemporal information corresponding to non-vowel segments less important\nthan the vowel-based information. Explainability of the high-level information\ncapturing the segment-by-segment decisions is further inspected for\nparticipants with and without depression. The findings from this work can\nprovide the foundation toward knowledge-driven interpretable decision-support\nsystems that can assist clinicians to better understand fine-grain temporal\nchanges in speech data, ultimately augmenting mental health diagnosis and care.",

The plasmonic absorption is sensed\nutilizing photoacoustic (PA) detection technique. The laser diode is modulated\nto generate the PA excitation that oscillates the air-filled cell. When light\nabsorption increases, an enhanced acoustic signal is captured by a microphone.\nThe observed enhancement in the PA response is related to plasmonic absorption\nby the Au layers and the response is further enhanced by about 20% due to CdSe\nQDs. In our structure, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) wavelength is\napproximately 500 nm. The SPR is utilized for generating photocurrents in CdSe\nquantum dots. Due to energy transfer from the dot to closely spaced Au surface\nthrough thiol links, a smooth transmission channel of electrons is established\nthat forms a detectable photocurrent, which can be tuned by a bias voltage.\nThese plasmonic nanogap structures can enable higher sensitivity in\nphotovoltaics, photodetection and sensing.",

The\nprogress on generative models has been rapid in recent years. These large-scale\nmodels have had three impacts: firstly, the fluency of generation in both\nlanguage and vision modalities has rendered common average-case evaluation\nmetrics much less useful in diagnosing system errors. Secondly, the same\nsubstrate models now form the basis of a number of applications, driven both by\nthe utility of their representations as well as phenomena such as in-context\nlearning, which raise the abstraction level of interacting with such models.\nThirdly, the user expectations around these models and their feted public\nreleases have made the technical challenge of out of domain generalization much\nless excusable in practice. Subsequently, our evaluation methodologies haven't\nadapted to these changes. More concretely, while the associated utility and\nmethods of interacting with generative models have expanded, a similar\nexpansion has not been observed in their evaluation practices. In this paper,\nwe argue that the scale of generative models could be exploited to raise the\nabstraction level at which evaluation itself is conducted and provide\nrecommendations for the same. Our recommendations are based on leveraging\nspecifications as a powerful instrument to evaluate generation quality and are\nreadily applicable to a variety of tasks.",

This hydrophobicity increases with increasing temperature and\nposes a competing self-assembling mechanism to the solvent induces hydrophobic\ninteractions between the middle-blocks of F108 at higher temperatures and leads\nto a macroscopic phase separation that is absent in the pure F108 system.\nHowever, when we attached short, hydrophilic single-stranded (ss)DNA to the\nazide groups via click chemistry the chain ends became 'sticky' due to DNA\nhybridisation below the melting temperature of the complementary ssDNA ends\nwhile reverting to hydrophilic behaviour above. We characterise their\nstructural and rheological properties via Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and\nDLS-based passive microrheology with an improved time-frequency domain\ninversion step.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-task encoder-decoder\npre-training framework (MMSpeech) for Mandarin automatic speech recognition\n(ASR), which employs both unlabeled speech and text data. The main difficulty\nin speech-text joint pre-training comes from the significant difference between\nspeech and text modalities, especially for Mandarin speech and text. Unlike\nEnglish and other languages with an alphabetic writing system, Mandarin uses an\nideographic writing system where character and sound are not tightly mapped to\none another. Therefore, we propose to introduce the phoneme modality into\npre-training, which can help capture modality-invariant information between\nMandarin speech and text. Specifically, we employ a multi-task learning\nframework including five self-supervised and supervised tasks with speech and\ntext data. For end-to-end pre-training, we introduce self-supervised\nspeech-to-pseudo-codes (S2C) and phoneme-to-text (P2T) tasks utilizing\nunlabeled speech and text data, where speech-pseudo-codes pairs and\nphoneme-text pairs are a supplement to the supervised speech-text pairs. To\ntrain the encoder to learn better speech representation, we introduce\nself-supervised masked speech prediction (MSP) and supervised phoneme\nprediction (PP) tasks to learn to map speech into phonemes. Besides, we\ndirectly add the downstream supervised speech-to-text (S2T) task into the\npre-training process, which can further improve the pre-training performance\nand achieve better recognition results even without fine-tuning. Experiments on\nAISHELL-1 show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nwith a more than 40% relative improvement compared with other pre-training\nmethods.",

        "abstract": "Although a wide variety of handcrafted concurrent data structures have been\nproposed, there is considerable interest in universal approaches (henceforth\ncalled Universal Constructions or UCs) for building concurrent data structures.\nThese approaches (semi-)automatically convert a sequential data structure into\na concurrent one. The simplest approach uses locks that protect a sequential\ndata structure and allow only one process to access it at a time. The resulting\ndata structures use locks, and hence are blocking. Most work on UCs instead\nfocuses on obtaining non-blocking progress guarantees such as\nobstruction-freedom, lock-freedom, or wait-freedom. Many non-blocking UCs have\nappeared. Key examples include the seminal wait-free UC by Herlihy, a\nNUMA-aware UC by Yi et al., and an efficient UC for large objects by Fatourou\net al.\n  We borrow ideas from persistent data structures and multi-version concurrency\ncontrol (MVCC), most notably path copying, and use them to implement concurrent\nversions of sequential persistent data structures. Despite our expectation that\nour data structures would not scale under write-heavy workloads, they scale in\npractice. We confirm this scaling analytically in our model with private\nper-process caches.",

        "abstract": "Point clouds captured by scanning devices are often incomplete due to\nocclusion. To overcome this limitation, point cloud completion methods have\nbeen developed to predict the complete shape of an object based on its partial\ninput. These methods can be broadly classified as supervised or unsupervised.\nHowever, both categories require a large number of 3D complete point clouds,\nwhich may be difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose Cross-PCC, an\nunsupervised point cloud completion method without requiring any 3D complete\npoint clouds. We only utilize 2D images of the complete objects, which are\neasier to capture than 3D complete and clean point clouds. Specifically, to\ntake advantage of the complementary information from 2D images, we use a\nsingle-view RGB image to extract 2D features and design a fusion module to fuse\nthe 2D and 3D features extracted from the partial point cloud. To guide the\nshape of predicted point clouds, we project the predicted points of the object\nto the 2D plane and use the foreground pixels of its silhouette maps to\nconstrain the position of the projected points. To reduce the outliers of the\npredicted point clouds, we propose a view calibrator to move the points\nprojected to the background into the foreground by the single-view silhouette\nimage. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first point cloud\ncompletion method that does not require any 3D supervision. The experimental\nresults of our method are superior to those of the state-of-the-art\nunsupervised methods by a large margin. Moreover, our method even achieves\ncomparable performance to some supervised methods. We will make the source code\npublicly available at https:\/\/github.com\/ltwu6\/cross-pcc.",

        "abstract": "Quantum machine learning has become an area of growing interest but has\ncertain theoretical and hardware-specific limitations. Notably, the problem of\nvanishing gradients, or barren plateaus, renders the training impossible for\ncircuits with high qubit counts, imposing a limit on the number of qubits that\ndata scientists can use for solving problems. Independently, angle-embedded\nsupervised quantum neural networks were shown to produce truncated Fourier\nseries with a degree directly dependent on two factors: the depth of the\nencoding and the number of parallel qubits the encoding applied to. The degree\nof the Fourier series limits the model expressivity. This work introduces two\nnew architectures whose Fourier degrees grow exponentially: the sequential and\nparallel exponential quantum machine learning architectures. This is done by\nefficiently using the available Hilbert space when encoding, increasing the\nexpressivity of the quantum encoding. Therefore, the exponential growth allows\nstaying at the low-qubit limit to create highly expressive circuits avoiding\nbarren plateaus. Practically, parallel exponential architecture was shown to\noutperform the existing linear architectures by reducing their final mean\nsquare error value by up to 44.7% in a one-dimensional test problem.\nFurthermore, the feasibility of this technique was also shown on a trapped ion\nquantum processing unit.",

Here, using colloidal quantum dot molecules, a new class of\ncoupled quantum dot dimers, we computationally demonstrate how the\nhybridization energy between the donor and acceptor quantum dots can be tuned\nby simply changing the neck dimensions and\/or the quantum dot size. This\nprovides a handle to tune the electron transfer from the nonadiabatic\nover-damped Marcus regime to the coherent adiabatic regime in a single system,\nwithout changing the reorganization energy, $\\lambda$, or the typical phonon\nfrequency, $\\omega_c$. We develop an atomistic model to account for several\ndonor and acceptor states and how they couple to the lattice vibrations, and\nutilize the Ehrenfest mean-field mixed quantum-classical method to describe the\ncharge transfer dynamics as the nonadiabatic parameter, $\\gamma$, is varied. We\nfind that charge transfer rates increase by several orders of magnitude as the\nsystem is driven to the coherent, adiabatic limit, even at elevated\ntemperatures, and delineate the inter-dot and torsional acoustic modes that\ncouple most strongly to the charge transfer reaction coordinate.",

The SimpleMind framework brings thinking to DNNs by: (1)\nproviding methods for reasoning with the knowledge base about image content,\nsuch as spatial inferencing and conditional reasoning to check DNN outputs; (2)\napplying process knowledge, in the form of general-purpose software agents,\nthat are chained together to accomplish image preprocessing, DNN prediction,\nand result post-processing, and (3) performing automatic co-optimization of all\nknowledge base parameters to adapt agents to specific problems. SimpleMind\nenables reasoning on multiple detected objects to ensure consistency, providing\ncross checking between DNN outputs. This machine reasoning improves the\nreliability and trustworthiness of DNNs through an interpretable model and\nexplainable decisions.

Leveraging contextual dependency to distinguish\nnested entities, we propose a Biaffine-based Contrastive Learning (BCL)\nframework. We first design a Biaffine span representation module for learning\nthe contextual span dependency representation for each entity span rather than\nonly learning its semantic representation. We then merge these two\nrepresentations by the residual connection to distinguish nested entities.\nFinally, we build a contrastive learning framework to adjust the representation\ndistribution for larger margin boundaries and more generalized domain transfer\nlearning ability. We conducted experimental studies on three English, German,\nand Russian nested NER datasets. The results show that the BCL outperformed\nthree baseline models on the 1-shot and 5-shot tasks in terms of F1 score.",

        "abstract": "Learning-based infrared small object detection methods currently rely heavily\non the classification backbone network. This tends to result in tiny object\nloss and feature distinguishability limitations as the network depth increases.\nFurthermore, small objects in infrared images are frequently emerged bright and\ndark, posing severe demands for obtaining precise object contrast information.\nFor this reason, we in this paper propose a simple and effective ``U-Net in\nU-Net'' framework, UIU-Net for short, and detect small objects in infrared\nimages. As the name suggests, UIU-Net embeds a tiny U-Net into a larger U-Net\nbackbone, enabling the multi-level and multi-scale representation learning of\nobjects. Moreover, UIU-Net can be trained from scratch, and the learned\nfeatures can enhance global and local contrast information effectively. More\nspecifically, the UIU-Net model is divided into two modules: the\nresolution-maintenance deep supervision (RM-DS) module and the\ninteractive-cross attention (IC-A) module. RM-DS integrates Residual U-blocks\ninto a deep supervision network to generate deep multi-scale\nresolution-maintenance features while learning global context information.\nFurther, IC-A encodes the local context information between the low-level\ndetails and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments conducted on\ntwo infrared single-frame image datasets, i.e., SIRST and Synthetic datasets,\nshow the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UIU-Net in comparison\nwith several state-of-the-art infrared small object detection methods. The\nproposed UIU-Net also produces powerful generalization performance for video\nsequence infrared small object datasets, e.g., ATR ground\/air video sequence\ndataset.

        "title": "SoftCorrect: Error Correction with Soft Detection for Automatic Speech Recognition",
        "abstract": "Error correction in automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to correct those\nincorrect words in sentences generated by ASR models. Since recent ASR models\nusually have low word error rate (WER), to avoid affecting originally correct\ntokens, error correction models should only modify incorrect words, and\ntherefore detecting incorrect words is important for error correction. Previous\nworks on error correction either implicitly detect error words through\ntarget-source attention or CTC (connectionist temporal classification) loss, or\nexplicitly locate specific deletion\/substitution\/insertion errors. However,\nimplicit error detection does not provide clear signal about which tokens are\nincorrect and explicit error detection suffers from low detection accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose SoftCorrect with a soft error detection mechanism to\navoid the limitations of both explicit and implicit error detection.\nSpecifically, we first detect whether a token is correct or not through a\nprobability produced by a dedicatedly designed language model, and then design\na constrained CTC loss that only duplicates the detected incorrect tokens to\nlet the decoder focus on the correction of error tokens. Compared with implicit\nerror detection with CTC loss, SoftCorrect provides explicit signal about which\nwords are incorrect and thus does not need to duplicate every token but only\nincorrect tokens; compared with explicit error detection, SoftCorrect does not\ndetect specific deletion\/substitution\/insertion errors but just leaves it to\nCTC loss. Experiments on AISHELL-1 and Aidatatang datasets show that\nSoftCorrect achieves 26.1% and 9.4% CER reduction respectively, outperforming\nprevious works by a large margin, while still enjoying fast speed of parallel\ngeneration.",

Therefore, we present a Vision-Based\nTerrain-Aware Locomotion (ViTAL) strategy that consists of novel pose\nadaptation and foothold selection algorithms.

ViTAL plans footholds and poses based on skills that\ncharacterize the robot's capabilities and its terrain-awareness. We use the 90\nkg HyQ and 140 kg HyQReal quadruped robots to validate ViTAL, and show that\nthey are able to climb various obstacles including stairs, gaps, and rough\nterrains at different speeds and gaits. We compare ViTAL with a baseline\nstrategy that selects the robot pose based on given selected footholds, and\nshow that ViTAL outperforms the baseline.",

        "abstract": "The reconstruction and novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes recently gained\nincreased attention. As reconstruction from large-scale multi-view data\ninvolves immense memory and computational requirements, recent benchmark\ndatasets provide collections of single monocular views per timestamp sampled\nfrom multiple (virtual) cameras. We refer to this form of inputs as\n\"monocularized\" data. Existing work shows impressive results for synthetic\nsetups and forward-facing real-world data, but is often limited in the training\nspeed and angular range for generating novel views. This paper addresses these\nlimitations and proposes a new method for full 360{\\deg} inward-facing novel\nview synthesis of non-rigidly deforming scenes. At the core of our method are:\n1) An efficient deformation module that decouples the processing of spatial and\ntemporal information for accelerated training and inference; and 2) A static\nmodule representing the canonical scene as a fast hash-encoded neural radiance\nfield. In addition to existing synthetic monocularized data, we systematically\nanalyze the performance on real-world inward-facing scenes using a newly\nrecorded challenging dataset sampled from a synchronized large-scale multi-view\nrig. In both cases, our method is significantly faster than previous methods,\nconverging in less than 7 minutes and achieving real-time framerates at 1K\nresolution, while obtaining a higher visual accuracy for generated novel views.\nOur source code and data is available at our project page\nhttps:\/\/graphics.tu-bs.de\/publications\/kappel2022fast.",

To\nimplement efficient and safe disinfection services during the pandemic, robots\nhave been utilized for indoor assets. In this paper, we envision the use of\ndrones for disinfection of outdoor assets in hospitals and other facilities.\nSuch heterogeneous assets may have different service demands (e.g., service\ntime, quantity of the disinfectant material etc.), whereas drones have\ntypically limited capacity (i.e., travel time, disinfectant carrying capacity).\nTo serve all the facility assets in an efficient manner, the drone to assets\nallocation and drone travel routes must be optimized. In this paper, we\nformulate the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) to find optimal route\nfor each drone such that the total service time is minimized, while\nsimultaneously the drones meet the demands of each asset allocated to it. The\nproblem is solved using mixed integer programming (MIP). As CVRP is an NP-hard\nproblem, we propose a lightweight heuristic to achieve sub-optimal performance\nwhile reducing the time complexity in solving the problem involving a large\nnumber of assets.",

The feature extraction technique is based on\na simplified stereo signal model considering auditory events positioned towards\na given direction in the stereo field using amplitude panning (AP) techniques.\nWe decompose the stereo signal into a set of directional signals for given AP\nvalues in the Short-Time Fourier Transform domain and calculate their overall\nloudness to form a directional loudness representation or maps. Then, we\ncompare directional loudness maps of a reference signal and a deteriorated\nversion to derive a distortion measure aiming to describe the associated\nperceived degradation scores reported in listening tests. The measure is then\ntested on an extensive listening test database with stereo signals processed by\nstate-of-the-art perceptual audio codecs using non waveform-preserving\ntechniques such as bandwidth extension and joint stereo coding, known for\npresenting a challenge to existing quality predictors. Results suggest that the\nderived distortion measure can be incorporated as an extension to existing\nautomated perceptual quality assessment algorithms for improving prediction on\nspatially coded audio signals.",

However, this raises\nthe question of which subset of the available unlabeled data should be selected\nfor transcription. Our work investigates different unsupervised data selection\ntechniques for fine-tuning the HuBERT model under a limited transcription\nbudget. We investigate the impact of speaker diversity, gender bias, and topic\ndiversity on the downstream ASR performance. We also devise two novel\ntechniques for unsupervised data selection: pre-training loss based data\nselection and the perplexity of byte pair encoded clustered units (PBPE) and we\nshow how these techniques compare to pure random data selection. Finally, we\nanalyze the correlations between the inherent characteristics of the selected\nfine-tuning subsets as well as how these characteristics correlate with the\nresultant word error rate. We demonstrate the importance of token diversity,\nspeaker diversity, and topic diversity in achieving the best performance in\nterms of WER.",

        "abstract": "Surgical activity recognition and prediction can help provide important\ncontext in many Robot-Assisted Surgery (RAS) applications, for example,\nsurgical progress monitoring and estimation, surgical skill evaluation, and\nshared control strategies during teleoperation. Transformer models were first\ndeveloped for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to model word sequences and\nsoon the method gained popularity for general sequence modeling tasks. In this\npaper, we propose the novel use of a Transformer model for three tasks: gesture\nrecognition, gesture prediction, and trajectory prediction during RAS. We\nmodify the original Transformer architecture to be able to generate the current\ngesture sequence, future gesture sequence, and future trajectory sequence\nestimations using only the current kinematic data of the surgical robot\nend-effectors. We evaluate our proposed models on the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill\nAssessment Working Set (JIGSAWS) and use Leave-One-User-Out (LOUO)\ncross-validation to ensure the generalizability of our results. Our models\nachieve up to 89.3\\% gesture recognition accuracy, 84.6\\% gesture prediction\naccuracy (1 second ahead) and 2.71mm trajectory prediction error (1 second\nahead). Our models are comparable to and able to outperform state-of-the-art\nmethods while using only the kinematic data channel. This approach can enable\nnear-real time surgical activity recognition and prediction.",

        "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation has been actively studied in fields such as robot\nvision, autonomous driving, and 3D scene understanding. Given a sequence of\ncolor images, unsupervised learning methods based on the framework of\nStructure-From-Motion (SfM) simultaneously predict depth and camera relative\npose. However, dynamically moving objects in the scene violate the static world\nassumption, resulting in inaccurate depths of dynamic objects. In this work, we\npropose a new method to address such dynamic object movements through monocular\n3D object detection. Specifically, we first detect 3D objects in the images and\nbuild the per-pixel correspondence of the dynamic pixels with the detected\nobject pose while leaving the static pixels corresponding to the rigid\nbackground to be modeled with camera motion. In this way, the depth of every\npixel can be learned via a meaningful geometry model. Besides, objects are\ndetected as cuboids with absolute scale, which is used to eliminate the scale\nambiguity problem inherent in monocular vision. Experiments on the KITTI depth\ndataset show that our method achieves State-of-The-Art performance for depth\nestimation. Furthermore, joint training of depth, camera motion and object pose\nalso improves monocular 3D object detection performance. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work that allows a monocular 3D object detection\nnetwork to be fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner.",

Multilingual pre-trained language models can be trained on\nmultiple languages, and the model can understand multiple languages at the same\ntime. At present, the search on pre-trained models mainly focuses on rich\nresources, while there is relatively little research on low-resource languages\nsuch as minority languages, and the public multilingual pre-trained language\nmodel can not work well for minority languages. Therefore, this paper\nconstructs a multilingual pre-trained model named MiLMo that performs better on\nminority language tasks, including Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh and\nKorean. To solve the problem of scarcity of datasets on minority languages and\nverify the effectiveness of the MiLMo model, this paper constructs a minority\nmultilingual text classification dataset named MiTC, and trains a word2vec\nmodel for each language. By comparing the word2vec model and the pre-trained\nmodel in the text classification task, this paper provides an optimal scheme\nfor the downstream task research of minority languages. The final experimental\nresults show that the performance of the pre-trained model is better than that\nof the word2vec model, and it has achieved the best results in minority\nmultilingual text classification.

A key challenge in melody\ntranscription is building methods which can handle broad audio containing any\nnumber of instrument ensembles and musical styles - existing strategies work\nwell for some melody instruments or styles but not all. To confront this\nchallenge, we leverage representations from Jukebox (Dhariwal et al. 2020), a\ngenerative model of broad music audio, thereby improving performance on melody\ntranscription by $20$% relative to conventional spectrogram features. Another\nobstacle in melody transcription is a lack of training data - we derive a new\ndataset containing $50$ hours of melody transcriptions from crowdsourced\nannotations of broad music. The combination of generative pre-training and a\nnew dataset for this task results in $77$% stronger performance on melody\ntranscription relative to the strongest available baseline. By pairing our new\nmelody transcription approach with solutions for beat detection, key\nestimation, and chord recognition, we build Sheet Sage, a system capable of\ntranscribing human-readable lead sheets directly from music audio.\n  Audio examples can be found at https:\/\/chrisdonahue.com\/sheetsage and code at\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/chrisdonahue\/sheetsage .",

        "abstract": "Perceptual speech quality is an important performance metric for\nteleconferencing applications. The mean opinion score (MOS) is standardized for\nthe perceptual evaluation of speech quality and is obtained by asking listeners\nto rate the quality of a speech sample. Recently, there has been increasing\nresearch interest in developing models for estimating MOS blindly. Here we\npropose a multi-task framework to include additional labels and data in\ntraining to improve the performance of a blind MOS estimation model.\nExperimental results indicate that the proposed model can be trained to jointly\nestimate MOS, reverberation time (T60), and clarity (C50) by combining two\ndisjoint data sets in training, one containing only MOS labels and the other\ncontaining only T60 and C50 labels. Furthermore, we use a semi-supervised\nframework to combine two MOS data sets in training, one containing only MOS\nlabels (per ITU-T Recommendation P.808), and the other containing separate\nscores for speech signal, background noise, and overall quality (per ITU-T\nRecommendation P.835). Finally, we present preliminary results for addressing\nindividual rater bias in the MOS labels.",

To improve system efficiency, query-driven techniques are\nutilized to reduce the runtime of our system, providing fast responses to user\nqueries.

Although existing\nlearning-based methods assume that the number of agents is the same as that in\nthe training environment, the number might differ in reality considering that\nthe robots' batteries may completely discharge, or additional robots may be\nintroduced to reduce the time required to complete a task. Therefore, it is\ncrucial that the learned strategy be applicable to scenarios wherein the number\nof agents differs from that in the training environment. In this paper, we\npropose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework of event-triggered\ncommunication and consensus-based control for distributed cooperative\ntransport. The proposed policy model estimates the resultant force and torque\nin a consensus manner using the estimates of the resultant force and torque\nwith the neighborhood agents. Moreover, it computes the control and\ncommunication inputs to determine when to communicate with the neighboring\nagents under local observations and estimates of the resultant force and\ntorque. Therefore, the proposed framework can balance the control performance\nand communication savings in scenarios wherein the number of agents differs\nfrom that in the training environment. We confirm the effectiveness of our\napproach by using a maximum of eight and six robots in the simulations and\nexperiments, respectively.",

To circumvent the need for magnetic-based\ntuning, we propose a field-effect Josephson diode based on the electrostatic\ngate control of finite momentum Cooper pairs in asymmetric\nspin-momentum-locking states. We propose two possible implementations of our\ngate-controlled mechanism: (i) a topological field-effect Josephson diode in\ntime-reversal-broken quantum spin Hall insulators; and (ii) semiconductor-based\nfield-effect Josephson diodes attainable in current experimental setups\ninvolving a Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling. Notably, the diode efficiency\nis highly enhanced in the topological field-effect Josephson diode because the\ncurrent carried by the asymmetric helical edge states is topologically\nprotected and can be tuned by local gates. In the proposed Josephson diode, the\ncombination of gates and asymmetric spin-momentum-locking nature is equivalent\nto that of a magnetic field, thus providing an alternative electrical operation\nin designing nonreciprocal superconducting devices.",

Our method is based on a kernel grid, a causal spline,\na regularization using the second-derivative roughness penalty, and the L-curve\ncriterion. We also develop the L-curve averaged deviation to estimate the\nprecision of our analytic continuation. To deal with statistically obtained\ndata more efficiently, we further develop a bootstrap-averaged analytic\ncontinuation method. In the test using the exact imaginary-frequency Green's\nfunction with added statistical error, our method produces the spectral\nfunction that converges systematically to the exact one as the statistical\nerror decreases. As an application, we simulate the two-orbital Hubbard model\nfor various electron numbers with the dynamical-mean field theory in the\nimaginary time and obtain the real-frequency self-energy with our analytic\ncontinuation method, clearly identifying a non-Fermi liquid behavior as the\nelectron number approaches the half filling from the quarter filling. Our\nanalytic continuation can be used widely and it will facilitate drawing clear\nconclusions from imaginary-time quantum many-body calculations.",

As a demonstration, we compute the spin\nwave spectral functions of two magnetic metals. The computed magnon spectra for\nhalf-metallic CrO$_2$ and a Heusler intermetallic Cu$_2$MnAl show gapless\nGoldstone modes when spin rotation symmetry is preserved and display reasonable\nagreement with available experimental data. The Landau damping is computed to\nbe small in CrO$_2$, but significant in Cu$_2$MnAl producing an asymmetric\nLorentzian spectral lineshape.

For training our models, we curate InfoPop, the\nfirst dataset containing popularity labels for over 1.7 million sentences from\nover 50,000 online news documents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst dataset automatically created using streams of incoming search engine\nqueries to generate sentence-level popularity annotations.

Our proposed technique coupled with a BERT-based neural model\nexceeds nDCG values of 0.8 for proactive sentence-specific popularity\nforecasting.

We performed two simulation studies to evaluate ML and\nimproved ML estimators with their covariance matrices in (i) a regression\nframework (ii) the Multiple Comparison Procedures with Modeling Techniques\nframework. We have shown that improved ML estimators are less biased than ML\nestimators yielding Wald-type statistics that controls type I error without\nloss of power in both frameworks.

Our findings suggest that most current VATs have overwhelming user\ninterfaces, poor interaction techniques, and difficult-to-understand features.\nThese often lead to longer annotation time, label inconsistencies, and user\nfatigue. We introduce FEVA, a video annotation tool with streamlined\ninteraction techniques and a dynamic interface that makes labeling tasks easy\nand fast. FEVA focuses on speed, accuracy, and simplicity to make annotation\nquick, consistent, and straightforward. For example, annotators can control the\nspeed and direction of the video and mark the onset and the offset of a label\nin real time with single key presses. In our user study, FEVA users, on\naverage, require 36% less interaction than the most popular annotation tools\n(Advene, ANVIL, ELAN, VIA, and VIAN).

        "title": "FlatENN: Train Flat for Enhanced Fault Tolerance of Quantized Deep Neural Networks",
        "abstract": "Model compression via quantization and sparsity enhancement has gained an\nimmense interest to enable the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) in\nresource-constrained edge environments. Although these techniques have shown\npromising results in reducing the energy, latency and memory requirements of\nthe DNNs, their performance in non-ideal real-world settings (such as in the\npresence of hardware faults) is yet to be completely understood. In this paper,\nwe investigate the impact of bit-flip and stuck-at faults on activation-sparse\nquantized DNNs (QDNNs). We show that a high level of activation sparsity comes\nat the cost of larger vulnerability to faults. For instance, activation-sparse\nQDNNs exhibit up to 17.32% lower accuracy than the standard QDNNs. We also\nestablish that one of the major cause of the degraded accuracy is sharper\nminima in the loss landscape for activation-sparse QDNNs, which makes them more\nsensitive to perturbations in the weight values due to faults. Based on this\nobservation, we propose the mitigation of the impact of faults by employing a\nsharpness-aware quantization (SAQ) training scheme. The activation-sparse and\nstandard QDNNs trained with SAQ have up to 36.71% and 24.76% higher inference\naccuracy, respectively compared to their conventionally trained equivalents.\nMoreover, we show that SAQ-trained activation-sparse QDNNs show better accuracy\nin faulty settings than standard QDNNs trained conventionally. Thus the\nproposed technique can be instrumental in achieving sparsity-related\nenergy\/latency benefits without compromising on fault tolerance.",

We\nfurther propose specific contrastive losses to help our network learn\ninvariance from id-unrelated and id-related augmentations.

        "abstract": "Deep learning models are known to put the privacy of their training data at\nrisk, which poses challenges for their safe and ethical release to the public.\nDifferentially private stochastic gradient descent is the de facto standard for\ntraining neural networks without leaking sensitive information about the\ntraining data. However, applying it to models for graph-structured data poses a\nnovel challenge: unlike with i.i.d. data, sensitive information about a node in\na graph cannot only leak through its gradients, but also through the gradients\nof all nodes within a larger neighborhood. In practice, this limits\nprivacy-preserving deep learning on graphs to very shallow graph neural\nnetworks. We propose to solve this issue by training graph neural networks on\ndisjoint subgraphs of a given training graph. We develop three\nrandom-walk-based methods for generating such disjoint subgraphs and perform a\ncareful analysis of the data-generating distributions to provide strong privacy\nguarantees.

        "abstract": "Deploying reliable deep learning techniques in interdisciplinary applications\nneeds learned models to output accurate and (even more importantly) explainable\npredictions. Existing approaches typically explicate network outputs in a\npost-hoc fashion, under an implicit assumption that faithful explanations come\nfrom accurate predictions\/classifications. We have an opposite claim that\nexplanations boost (or even determine) classification. That is, end-to-end\nlearning of explanation factors to augment discriminative representation\nextraction could be a more intuitive strategy to inversely assure fine-grained\nexplainability, e.g., in those neuroimaging and neuroscience studies with\nhigh-dimensional data containing noisy, redundant, and task-irrelevant\ninformation. In this paper, we propose such an explainable geometric deep\nnetwork dubbed as NeuroExplainer, with applications to uncover altered infant\ncortical development patterns associated with preterm birth. Given fundamental\ncortical attributes as network input, our NeuroExplainer adopts a hierarchical\nattention-decoding framework to learn fine-grained attentions and respective\ndiscriminative representations to accurately recognize preterm infants from\nterm-born infants at term-equivalent age. NeuroExplainer learns the\nhierarchical attention-decoding modules under subject-level weak supervision\ncoupled with targeted regularizers deduced from domain knowledge regarding\nbrain development. These prior-guided constraints implicitly maximizes the\nexplainability metrics (i.e., fidelity, sparsity, and stability) in network\ntraining, driving the learned network to output detailed explanations and\naccurate classifications. Experimental results on the public dHCP benchmark\nsuggest that NeuroExplainer led to quantitatively reliable explanation results\nthat are qualitatively consistent with representative neuroimaging studies.",

MGTAB contains 10,199 expert-annotated users and 7 types of\nrelationships, ensuring high-quality annotation and diversified relations. In\nMGTAB, we extracted the 20 user property features with the greatest information\ngain and user tweet features as the user features. In addition, we performed a\nthorough evaluation of MGTAB and other public datasets. Our experiments found\nthat graph-based approaches are generally more effective than feature-based\napproaches and perform better when introducing multiple relations. By analyzing\nexperiment results, we identify effective approaches for account detection and\nprovide potential future research directions in this field. Our benchmark and\nstandardized evaluation procedures are freely available at:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/GraphDetec\/MGTAB.",

        "abstract": "Thorough testing of safety-critical autonomous systems, such as self-driving\ncars, autonomous robots, and drones, is essential for detecting potential\nfailures before deployment. One crucial testing stage is model-in-the-loop\ntesting, where the system model is evaluated by executing various scenarios in\na simulator. However, the search space of possible parameters defining these\ntest scenarios is vast, and simulating all combinations is computationally\ninfeasible. To address this challenge, we introduce AmbieGen, a search-based\ntest case generation framework for autonomous systems. AmbieGen uses\nevolutionary search to identify the most critical scenarios for a given system,\nand has a modular architecture that allows for the addition of new systems\nunder test, algorithms, and search operators. Currently, AmbieGen supports test\ncase generation for autonomous robots and autonomous car lane keeping assist\nsystems. In this paper, we provide a high-level overview of the framework's\narchitecture and demonstrate its practical use cases.",

        "abstract": "The coupling interactions between deformable structures and unsteady fluid\nflows occur across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales in many\nengineering applications. These fluid-structure interactions (FSI) pose\nsignificant challenges in accurately predicting flow physics. In the present\nwork, two multi-layer network approaches are proposed that characterize the\ninteractions between the fluid and structural layers for an incompressible\nlaminar flow over a two-dimensional compliant flat plate at a 35-degrees angle\nof attack. In the first approach, the network nodes are formed by wake vortices\nand bound vortexlets, and the edges of the network are defined by the induced\nvelocity between these elements. In the second approach, coherent structures\n(fluid modes), contributing to the kinetic energy of the flow and structural\nmodes, contributing to the kinetic energy of the compliant structure constitute\nthe network nodes. The energy transfers between the modes are extracted using a\nperturbation approach. Furthermore, the network structure of the FSI system is\nsimplified using the community detection algorithm in the vortical approach and\nby selecting dominant modes in the modal approach. Network measures are used to\nreveal the temporal behavior of the individual nodes within the simplified FSI\nsystem. Predictive models are then built using both data-driven and\nphysics-based methods. Overall, this work sets the foundation for\nnetwork-theoretic reduced-order modeling of fluid-structure interactions,\ngeneralizable to other multi-physics systems.",

        "abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT) suffers from data scarcity in semi-supervised\nlearning (SSL). To alleviate this issue, inspired by masked autoencoder (MAE),\nwhich is a data-efficient self-supervised learner, we propose Semi-MAE, a pure\nViT-based SSL framework consisting of a parallel MAE branch to assist the\nvisual representation learning and make the pseudo labels more accurate. The\nMAE branch is designed as an asymmetric architecture consisting of a\nlightweight decoder and a shared-weights encoder. We feed the weakly-augmented\nunlabeled data with a high masking ratio to the MAE branch and reconstruct the\nmissing pixels. Semi-MAE achieves 75.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 10%\nlabels, surpassing prior state-of-the-art in semi-supervised image\nclassification. In addition, extensive experiments demonstrate that Semi-MAE\ncan be readily used for other ViT models and masked image modeling methods.",

Further investigation finds that core-localized electrons, within r\/a\n< 0.3 and with kinetic energies 0.2-15 MeV, contribute most to the RE plateau\nformation. Yet only a relatively small amount of transport, i.e. a diffusion\ncoefficient ~18 $\\mathrm{m^2\/s}$, is needed in the core to fully mitigate these\nREs.

Assuming immiscible surfactants forming an\nincompressible, inviscid surfactant phase at the gas-liquid interfaces we\nemploy a recently proposed model [Baier and Hardt, J.Fluid Mech., 949 (2022)]\nfor addressing this situation. Using a domain perturbation technique together\nwith the Lorentz reciprocal theorem we obtain the slip length characterizing\nthe flow over such surfaces to second order in the maximal interface deflection\nas a small parameter. We find that within the range of moderate interface\ndeflections studied, the slip length for flow over such surfaces is negative\n(positive) for surfaces protruding above (below) the surface and is much\nsmaller than for flow over a corresponding surfactant-free interface. Thus,\ncontrary to expectations of reduced drag in flow over superhydrophobic surfaces\nin Cassie state, surfactant covered interfaces can even be detrimental for drag\nreduction in the limit where surfactants act as an effectively incompressible\nsurface-fluid.

        "abstract": "Scalable quantum photonic technologies require low-loss integration of many\nidentical single-photon sources with photonic circuitry on a chip. Relatively\ncomplex quantum photonic circuits have already been demonstrated; however,\nsources used so far relied on parametric-down-conversion. Hence, the efficiency\nand scalability are intrinsically limited by the probabilistic nature of the\nsources. Quantum emitter-based single-photon sources are free of this\nlimitation, but frequency matching of multiple emitters within a single circuit\nremains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a key component in this\nregard in the form of a fully monolithic GaAs circuit combing two\nfrequency-matched quantum dot single-photon sources interconnected with a\nlow-loss on-chip beamsplitter connected via single-mode ridge waveguides. This\ndevice enabled us to perform a two-photon interference experiment on-chip with\nvisibility reaching 66%, limited by the coherence of the emitters. Our device\ncould be further scaled up, providing a clear path to increase the complexity\nof quantum circuits toward fully scalable integrated quantum technologies.",

To reduce the\nexperimental cost, we exploit the state-engineering mechanisms of both\nconditional and unconditional measurements and propose a two-step protocol\nassisted by a qubit to cool a resonator down to the ground state with a\nnear-unit probability. In the first step, the unconditional measurements on the\nancillary qubit are applied to reshape the target resonator from a thermal\nstate to a reserved Fock state. The measurement sequence is optimized by\nreinforcement learning for a maximum fidelity. In the second step, the\npopulation on the reserved state can be faithfully transferred in a stepwise\nway to the resonator's ground state with a near-unit fidelity by the\nconditional measurements on the qubit. Intrinsic nondeterminacy of the\nprojection-based conditional measurement is effectively inhibited by properly\nspacing the measurement sequence, which makes the Kraus operator act as a\nlowering operator for neighboring Fock states.

        "abstract": "This paper aims to tackle the issues on unavailable or insufficient clinical\nUS data and meaningful annotation to enable bone segmentation and registration\nfor US-guided spinal surgery. While the US is not a standard paradigm for\nspinal surgery, the scarcity of intra-operative clinical US data is an\ninsurmountable bottleneck in training a neural network. Moreover, due to the\ncharacteristics of US imaging, it is difficult to clearly annotate bone\nsurfaces which causes the trained neural network missing its attention to the\ndetails. Hence, we propose an In silico bone US simulation framework that\nsynthesizes realistic US images from diagnostic CT volume. Afterward, using\nthese simulated bone US we train a lightweight vision transformer model that\ncan achieve accurate and on-the-fly bone segmentation for spinal sonography. In\nthe validation experiments, the realistic US simulation was conducted by\nderiving from diagnostic spinal CT volume to facilitate a radiation-free\nUS-guided pedicle screw placement procedure. When it is employed for training\nbone segmentation task, the Chamfer distance achieves 0.599mm; when it is\napplied for CT-US registration, the associated bone segmentation accuracy\nachieves 0.93 in Dice, and the registration accuracy based on the segmented\npoint cloud is 0.13~3.37mm in a complication-free manner. While bone US images\nexhibit strong echoes at the medium interface, it may enable the model\nindistinguishable between thin interfaces and bone surfaces by simply relying\non small neighborhood information. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose\nto utilize a Long-range Contrast Learning Module to fully explore the\nLong-range Contrast between the candidates and their surrounding pixels.",

        "title": "Learning Trajectory-Word Alignments for Video-Language Tasks",
        "abstract": "In a video, an object usually appears as the trajectory, i.e., it spans over\na few spatial but longer temporal patches, that contains abundant\nspatiotemporal contexts. However, modern Video-Language BERTs (VDL-BERTs)\nneglect this trajectory characteristic that they usually follow image-language\nBERTs (IL-BERTs) to deploy the patch-to-word (P2W) attention that may\nover-exploit trivial spatial contexts and neglect significant temporal\ncontexts. To amend this, we propose a novel TW-BERT to learn Trajectory-Word\nalignment by a newly designed trajectory-to-word (T2W) attention for solving\nvideo-language tasks. Moreover, previous VDL-BERTs usually uniformly sample a\nfew frames into the model while different trajectories have diverse graininess,\ni.e., some trajectories span longer frames and some span shorter, and using a\nfew frames will lose certain useful temporal contexts. However, simply sampling\nmore frames will also make pre-training infeasible due to the largely increased\ntraining burdens. To alleviate the problem, during the fine-tuning stage, we\ninsert a novel Hierarchical Frame-Selector (HFS) module into the video encoder.\nHFS gradually selects the suitable frames conditioned on the text context for\nthe later cross-modal encoder to learn better trajectory-word alignments. By\nthe proposed T2W attention and HFS, our TW-BERT achieves SOTA performances on\ntext-to-video retrieval tasks, and comparable performances on video\nquestion-answering tasks with some VDL-BERTs trained on much more data. The\ncode will be available in the supplementary material.",

Quantum\nbenchmarking provides key information on noise properties and is an important\nstep for developing more advanced quantum processors. However, current\nbenchmarking methods are either limited to a specific subset of quantum gates\nor cannot directly describe the performance of the individual target gate. To\novercome these limitations, we propose channel spectrum benchmarking (CSB), a\nmethod to infer the noise properties of the target gate, including process\nfidelity, stochastic fidelity, and some unitary parameters, from the\neigenvalues of its noisy channel. Our CSB method is insensitive to\nstate-preparation and measurement errors, and importantly, can benchmark\nuniversal gates and is scalable to many-qubit systems. Unlike standard\nrandomized schemes, CSB can provide direct noise information for both target\nnative gates and circuit fragments, allowing benchmarking and calibration of\nglobal entangling gates and frequently used modules in quantum algorithms like\nTrotterized Hamiltonian evolution operator in quantum simulation.",

To tackle these challenges, we propose a self-supervised masked\nsampling distillation method for the vision transformer.

We conducted\nextensive experiments on two different tasks, which demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our method. We achieved superior performance compared to the\nexisting distributed learning strategy as well as the fine-tuning only\nbaseline. Furthermore, since the self-supervised model created using our\nproposed method can achieve a general semantic understanding of the image, we\ndemonstrate its potential as a task-agnostic self-supervised foundation model\nfor various downstream tasks, thereby expanding its applicability in the\nmedical domain.",

In many SVS systems including our\nprevious work, phoneme-level score features are converted into frame-level ones\non the basis of phoneme boundaries obtained by external aligners to take into\naccount vocal timing deviations. Therefore, the sound quality is affected by\nthe aligner accuracy in this system. To alleviate this problem, we introduce an\nattention mechanism with frame-level features.

        "abstract": "Poster generation is a significant task for a wide range of applications,\nwhich is often time-consuming and requires lots of manual editing and artistic\nexperience. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven framework, called\n\\textit{Text2Poster}, to automatically generate visually-effective posters from\ntextual information. Imitating the process of manual poster editing, our\nframework leverages a large-scale pretrained visual-textual model to retrieve\nbackground images from given texts, lays out the texts on the images\niteratively by cascaded auto-encoders, and finally, stylizes the texts by a\nmatching-based method. We learn the modules of the framework by weakly- and\nself-supervised learning strategies, mitigating the demand for labeled data.\nBoth objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our Text2Poster\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, including academic research and\ncommercial software, on the quality of generated posters.",

        "abstract": "Viscoelastic fluids are a subclass of complex fluids used in widespread\napplications ranging from biological to large-scale industrial settings. These\nfluids are often associated with various complex flow phenomena due to the\npresence of non-linear elastic stresses, originating due to the stretching and\nrelaxation phenomena of microstructure (such as polymer molecules in the case\nof a viscoelastic polymer solution) in a deformed flow field. One such\nphenomenon is elastic instability (EI) which emerges due to the interaction\nbetween elastic stresses and streamline curvature present in a flow system at\nsmall values of the Renolds number (ratio of the inertial to that of the\nviscous forces) when the Weissenberg number (ratio of the microstructure\nrelaxation time to that of the rate of flow deformation) exceeds a critical\nvalue. On further increasing this Weissenberg number to higher values, the\nunstable flow field caused due to this elastic instability transits to a more\nchaotic and turbulent-like flow structure called elastic turbulence (ET). Over\nthe last two decades or so, an extensive investigation has been performed on\nthis particular topic in the complex fluids research community. Some excellent\narticles recently present this ET phenomenon's development, understanding, and\nprogress in the literature. This article focuses on the application\nperspectives of this phenomenon. In particular, this article aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of the investigations conducted so far in the literature\nto demonstrate the potential of these EI and ET phenomena in three main\napplication areas, namely, microfluidic mixing, microscale heat transfer, and\nchemically enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process. Additionally, a detailed\ndiscussion of the limitations and future directions of these EI and ET\nphenomena from an application point of view is also presented in this article.",

        "abstract": "Language models (LMs) compute the probability of a text by sequentially\ncomputing a representation of an already-seen context and using this\nrepresentation to predict the next word. Currently, most LMs calculate these\nrepresentations through a neural network consuming the immediate previous\ncontext. However recently, retrieval-augmented LMs have shown to improve over\nstandard neural LMs, by accessing information retrieved from a large datastore,\nin addition to their standard, parametric, next-word prediction. In this paper,\nwe set out to understand why retrieval-augmented language models, and\nspecifically why k-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs) perform better\nthan standard parametric LMs, even when the k-nearest neighbor component\nretrieves examples from the same training set that the LM was originally\ntrained on. To this end, we perform a careful analysis of the various\ndimensions over which kNN-LM diverges from standard LMs, and investigate these\ndimensions one by one. Empirically, we identify three main reasons why kNN-LM\nperforms better than standard LMs: using a different input representation for\npredicting the next tokens, approximate kNN search, and the importance of\nsoftmax temperature for the kNN distribution. Further, we incorporate these\ninsights into the model architecture or the training procedure of the standard\nparametric LM, improving its results without the need for an explicit retrieval\ncomponent.

        "abstract": "Micro- and nano-swimmers moving in a fluid solvent confined by structures\nthat produce entropic barriers are often described by overdamped active\nBrownian particle dynamics, where viscous effects are large and inertia plays\nno role. However, inertial effects should be considered for confined swimmers\nmoving in media where viscous effects are no longer dominant. Here, we study\nhow inertia affects the rectification and diffusion of self-propelled particles\nin a two-dimensional asymmetric channel. We show that most of the particles\naccumulate at the channel walls as the masses of the particles increase.\nFurthermore, the average particle velocity has a maximum as a function of the\nmass, indicating that particles with an optimal mass $M^{*}_{\\rm op}$ can be\nsorted from a mixture with particles of other masses. In particular, we find\nthat the effective diffusion coefficient exhibits an enhanced diffusion peak as\na function of the mass, which is a signature of the accumulation of most of the\nparticles at the channel walls. The dependence of $M^{*}_{\\rm op}$ on the\nrotational diffusion rate, self-propulsion force, aspect ratio of the channel,\nand active torque is also determined. The results of this study could stimulate\nthe development of strategies for controlling the diffusion of self-propelled\nparticles in entropic ratchet systems.",

        "abstract": "Automated segmentation of anatomical sub-regions with high precision has\nbecome a necessity to enable the quantification and characterization of cells\/\ntissues in histology images. Currently, a machine learning model to analyze\nsub-anatomical regions of the brain to analyze 2D histological images is not\navailable. The scientists rely on manually segmenting anatomical sub-regions of\nthe brain which is extremely time-consuming and prone to labeler-dependent\nbias. One of the major challenges in accomplishing such a task is the lack of\nhigh-quality annotated images that can be used to train a generic artificial\nintelligence model. In this study, we employed a UNet-based architecture,\ncompared model performance with various combinations of encoders, image sizes,\nand sample selection techniques. Additionally, to increase the sample set we\nresorted to data augmentation which provided data diversity and robust\nlearning. In this study, we trained our best fit model on approximately one\nthousand annotated 2D brain images stained with Nissl\/ Haematoxylin and\nTyrosine Hydroxylase enzyme (TH, indicator of dopaminergic neuron viability).\nThe dataset comprises of different animal studies enabling the model to be\ntrained on different datasets. The model effectively is able to detect two\nsub-regions compacta (SNCD) and reticulata (SNr) in all the images. In spite of\nlimited training data, our best model achieves a mean intersection over union\n(IOU) of 79% and a mean dice coefficient of 87%. In conclusion, the UNet-based\nmodel with EffiecientNet as an encoder outperforms all other encoders,\nresulting in a first of its kind robust model for multiclass segmentation of\nsub-brain regions in 2D images.",

        "abstract": "Semantic communications learned on background knowledge bases (KBs) have been\nidentified as a promising technology for communications between intelligent\nagents. Existing works assume that transceivers of semantic communications\nshare the same KB. However, intelligent transceivers may suffer from the\ncommunication burden or worry about privacy leakage to exchange data in KBs.\nBesides, the transceivers may independently learn from the environment and\ndynamically update their KBs, leading to timely sharing of the KBs infeasible.\nAll these cause the mismatch between the KBs, which may result in a\nsemantic-level misunderstanding on the receiver side. To address this issue, we\npropose a transceiver cooperative learning-assisted semantic communication\n(TCL-SC) scheme against mismatched KBs. In TCL-SC, the transceivers\ncooperatively train semantic encoder and decoder neuron networks (NNs) of the\nsame structure based on their own KBs. They periodically share the parameters\nof NNs. To reduce the communication overhead of parameter sharing, parameter\nquantization is adopted. Moreover, we discuss the impacts of the number of\ncommunication rounds on the performance of semantic communication systems.\nExperiments on real-world data demonstrate that our proposed TCL-SC can reduce\nthe semantic-level misunderstanding on the receiver side caused by the mismatch\nbetween the KBs, especially at the low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio regime.",

Egocentric video has several\ndistinguishing characteristics from those commonly found in past datasets:\nfrequent large camera motions and hand interactions with objects commonly lead\nto occlusions or objects exiting the frame, and object appearance can change\nrapidly due to widely different points of view, scale, or object states.\nEmbodied tracking is also naturally long-term, and being able to consistently\n(re-)associate objects to their appearances and disappearances over as long as\na lifetime is critical. Previous datasets under-emphasize this re-detection\nproblem, and their \"framed\" nature has led to adoption of various\nspatiotemporal priors that we find do not necessarily generalize to egocentric\nvideo. We thus introduce EgoTracks, a new dataset for long-term egocentric\nvisual object tracking.

Recent realizations of such elements include nanoplasmonic\nsystems with broken mirror symmetry and polarization-contrasting optical\nabsorption known as circular dichroism. An alternative route to circular\ndichroism is provided by spin-valley polarized excitons in atomically thin\nsemiconductors. In the presence of magnetic fields, they exhibit an imbalanced\ncoupling to circularly polarized photons and thus circular dichroism. Here, we\ndemonstrate that polarization-contrasting optical transitions associated with\nexcitons in monolayer WSe$_2$ can be transferred to proximal plasmonic\nnanodisks by coherent coupling. The coupled exciton-plasmon system exhibits\nmagneto-induced circular dichroism in a spectrally narrow window of Fano\ninterference, which we model in a master equation framework.

This approach allocates the sensing signals along the diagonal of\nthe time-frequency resource block. Therefore, the sensing signals in a linear\nstructure span both the frequency and time domains. The range and velocity of\nthe object can be estimated simultaneously by applying 1D-discrete Fourier\ntransform (DFT) to the diagonal sensing signals.

The present in-situ optical observations of such electric poling\nprocess reveal formation of a transient coexistence of the cubic and\nferroelectric phases, the latter one being broken into multiple martensitic\nsuperdomains, separated by superdomain walls. It is revealed that as the\ntransient superdomains convert into the regular ferroelectric domains, the\nsuperdomain boundaries transform into the desired charged domain walls. In\norder to assign the observed transient domain patterns, to understand the\nshapes of the observed ferrolectric precipitates and their agglomerates as well\nas to provide the overall interpretation of the observed domain formation\nprocess, the implications of the mechanical compatibility of the coexisting\nsuperdomain states is derived in the framework of the Wechsler-Lieberman-Read\ntheory.

        "abstract": "Current human activity recognition (HAR) techniques regard activity labels as\ninteger class IDs without explicitly modeling the semantics of class labels. We\nobserve that different activity names often have shared structures. For\nexample, \"open door\" and \"open fridge\" both have \"open\" as the action; \"kicking\nsoccer ball\" and \"playing tennis ball\" both have \"ball\" as the object. Such\nshared structures in label names can be translated to the similarity in sensory\ndata and modeling common structures would help uncover knowledge across\ndifferent activities, especially for activities with limited samples. In this\npaper, we propose SHARE, a HAR framework that takes into account shared\nstructures of label names for different activities. To exploit the shared\nstructures, SHARE comprises an encoder for extracting features from input\nsensory time series and a decoder for generating label names as a token\nsequence. We also propose three label augmentation techniques to help the model\nmore effectively capture semantic structures across activities, including a\nbasic token-level augmentation, and two enhanced embedding-level and\nsequence-level augmentations utilizing the capabilities of pre-trained models.\nSHARE outperforms state-of-the-art HAR models in extensive experiments on seven\nHAR benchmark datasets.

Scale-bridging machine learning surface\nsurrogate models have been demonstrated to perceive the fundamental atomic\nfidelity for the physical vapor deposition of pure metals. However, the immense\ncomputational cost of the data-generating simulations render a practical\napplication with predictions on relevant timescales impracticable. This issue\nis resolved in this work for the sputter deposition of AlN in Ar\/N$_2$\ndischarges by developing a scheme that populates the parameter spaces\neffectively. Hybrid reactive molecular dynamics \/ time-stamped force-bias Monte\nCarlo simulations of randomized plasma-surface interactions \/ diffusion\nprocesses are used to setup a physics-separating artificial neural network. The\napplication of this generic machine learning model to a specific experimental\nreference case study enables the systematic analysis of the particle flux\nemission as well as underlying system state (e.g., composition, mass density,\nstress, point defect structure) evolution within process times of up to 45\nminutes.",

Rapid sky localization of these sources is crucial to\nfacilitate such multi-messenger observations. Since GWs from binary neutron\nstar (BNS) mergers can spend up to 10-15 mins in the frequency bands of the\ndetectors at design sensitivity, early warning alerts and pre-merger sky\nlocalization can be achieved for sufficiently bright sources, as demonstrated\nin recent studies. In this work, we present pre-merger BNS sky localization\nresults using CBC-SkyNet, a deep learning model capable of inferring sky\nlocation posterior distributions of GW sources at orders of magnitude faster\nspeeds than standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We test our model's\nperformance on a catalog of simulated injections from Sachdev et al. (2020),\nrecovered at 0-60 secs before merger, and obtain comparable sky localization\nareas to the rapid localization tool BAYESTAR. These results show the\nfeasibility of our model for rapid pre-merger sky localization and the\npossibility of follow-up observations for precursor emissions from BNS mergers.",

Recently, there has been\nsignificant interest in rare earth ions, in particular Er$^{3+}$ for its\ntelecom-band optical transition, but their application has been hampered by\noptical spectral diffusion precluding indistinguishable single photon\ngeneration. In this work we implant Er$^{3+}$ into CaWO$_4$, a material that\ncombines a non-polar site symmetry, low decoherence from nuclear spins, and is\nfree of background rare earth ions, to realize significantly reduced optical\nspectral diffusion. For shallow implanted ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities\nwith large Purcell factor, we observe single-scan optical linewidths of 150 kHz\nand long-term spectral diffusion of 63 kHz, both close to the Purcell-enhanced\nradiative linewidth of 21 kHz. This enables the observation of Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterference between successively emitted photons with high visibility,\nmeasured after a 36 km delay line. We also observe spin relaxation times $T_1$\n= 3.7 s and $T_2$ > 200 $\\mu$s, with the latter limited by paramagnetic\nimpurities in the crystal instead of nuclear spins. This represents a\nsignificant step towards the construction of telecom-band quantum repeater\nnetworks with single Er$^{3+}$ ions.",

        "abstract": "By performing experiment and model studies on a triangular-lattice dipolar\nmagnet KBaGd(BO$_3$)$_2$ (KBGB), we find the highly frustrated magnet with a\nplanar anisotropy hosts a strongly fluctuating dipolar spin liquid (DSL), which\noriginates from the intriguing interplay between dipolar and Heisenberg\ninteractions. The DSL constitutes an extended regime in the field-temperature\nphase diagram, which gets lowered in temperature as field increases and\neventually ends with an unconventional quantum critical point (QCP) at\n$B_c\\simeq 0.75$~T. Based on dipolar Heisenberg model calculations, we identify\nthe DSL as a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase with emergent U(1)\nsymmetry. Due to the tremendous entropy accumulation that can be related to the\nstrong BKT and quantum fluctuations, unprecedented magnetic cooling effects are\nobserved in the DSL regime and particularly near the QCP, making KBGB a\nsuperior dipolar coolant to commercial Gd-based refrigerants. We establish the\nphase diagram for triangular-lattice dipolar quantum magnets where emergent\nsymmetry plays an essential role, and provide a basis and opens an avenue for\ntheir applications in sub-Kelvin refrigeration.",

        "title": "Video Semantic Segmentation with Inter-Frame Feature Fusion and Inner-Frame Feature Refinement",
        "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate semantic maps for each\nvideo frame. To this end, many works dedicate to integrate diverse information\nfrom consecutive frames to enhance the features for prediction, where a feature\nalignment procedure via estimated optical flow is usually required. However,\nthe optical flow would inevitably suffer from inaccuracy, and then introduce\nnoises in feature fusion and further result in unsatisfactory segmentation\nresults. In this paper, to tackle the misalignment issue, we propose a\nspatial-temporal fusion (STF) module to model dense pairwise relationships\namong multi-frame features. Different from previous methods, STF uniformly and\nadaptively fuses features at different spatial and temporal positions, and\navoids error-prone optical flow estimation. Besides, we further exploit feature\nrefinement within a single frame and propose a novel memory-augmented\nrefinement (MAR) module to tackle difficult predictions among semantic\nboundaries. Specifically, MAR can store the boundary features and prototypes\nextracted from the training samples, which together form the task-specific\nmemory, and then use them to refine the features during inference. Essentially,\nMAR can move the hard features closer to the most likely category and thus make\nthem more discriminative. We conduct extensive experiments on Cityscapes and\nCamVid, and the results show that our proposed methods significantly outperform\nprevious methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

        "abstract": "We propose a method for separating trapped atoms in optical lattices by large\ndistances. The key idea is the cyclic transfer of atoms between two lattices of\nvariable spacing, known as accordion lattices, each covering at least a factor\nof two in lattice spacing. By coherently loading atoms between the two\nsuperimposed potentials, we can reach, in principle, arbitrarily large atom\nseparations, while requiring only a relatively small numerical aperture.\nNumerical simulations of our `accordion superlattice' show that the atoms\nremain localised to one lattice site throughout the separation process, even\nfor moderate lattice depths. In a proof-of-principle experiment we demonstrate\nthe optical fields required for the accordion superlattice using acousto-optic\ndeflectors. The method can be applied to neutral-atom quantum computing with\noptical tweezers, as well as quantum simulation of low-entropy many-body\nstates. For instance, a unit-filling atomic Mott insulator can be coherently\nexpanded by a factor of ten in order to load an optical tweezer array with very\nhigh filling. In turn, sorted tweezer arrays can be compressed to form\nhigh-density states of ultracold atoms in optical lattices. The method can be\nalso be applied to biological systems where dynamical separation of particles\nis required.",

        "abstract": "Electronic transitions in molecules due to the absorption or emission of\nlight is a complex quantum mechanical process. Their study plays an important\nrole in the design of novel materials. A common yet challenging task in the\nstudy is to determine the nature of electronic transitions, namely which\nsubgroups of the molecule are involved in the transition by donating or\naccepting electrons, followed by an investigation of the variation in the\ndonor-acceptor behavior for different transitions or conformations of the\nmolecules. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the analysis of a\nbivariate field and show its applicability to the study of electronic\ntransitions. This approach is based on two novel operators, the continuous\nscatterplot (CSP) lens operator and the CSP peel operator, that enable\neffective visual analysis of bivariate fields. Both operators can be applied\nindependently or together to facilitate analysis. The operators motivate the\ndesign of control polygon inputs to extract fiber surfaces of interest in the\nspatial domain. The CSPs are annotated with a quantitative measure to further\nsupport the visual analysis. We study different molecular systems and\ndemonstrate how the CSP peel and CSP lens operators help identify and study\ndonor and acceptor characteristics in molecular systems.",

While a tunable probe source with photon energy of 5.3 - 7.0 eV has\nbeen recently implemented for TrARPES by using a KBe$_2$BO$_3$F$_2$ (KBBF)\ndevice, the time resolution of 280 - 320 fs is still not ideal, which is mainly\nlimited by the duration of the VUV probe pulse generated by the KBBF device.\nHere, by designing a new KBBF device which is specially optimized for fs\napplications, an optimum pulse duration of 55 fs is obtained after systematic\ndiagnostics and optimization. More importantly, a high time resolution of 81 -\n95 fs is achieved for TrARPES measurements covering the probe photon energy\nrange of 5.3 - 7.0 eV, making it particularly useful for investigating the\nultrafast dynamics of quantum materials.

        "abstract": "Quality-Diversity optimisation (QD) has proven to yield promising results\nacross a broad set of applications. However, QD approaches struggle in the\npresence of uncertainty in the environment, as it impacts their ability to\nquantify the true performance and novelty of solutions. This problem has been\nhighlighted multiple times independently in previous literature. In this work,\nwe propose to uniformise the view on this problem through four main\ncontributions. First, we formalise a common framework for uncertain domains:\nthe Uncertain QD setting, a special case of QD in which fitness and descriptors\nfor each solution are no longer fixed values but distribution over possible\nvalues. Second, we propose a new methodology to evaluate Uncertain QD\napproaches, relying on a new per-generation sampling budget and a set of\nexisting and new metrics specifically designed for Uncertain QD. Third, we\npropose three new Uncertain QD algorithms: Archive-sampling,\nParallel-Adaptive-sampling and Deep-Grid-sampling. We propose these approaches\ntaking into account recent advances in the QD community toward the use of\nhardware acceleration that enable large numbers of parallel evaluations and\nmake sampling an affordable approach to uncertainty. Our final and fourth\ncontribution is to use this new framework and the associated comparison methods\nto benchmark existing and novel approaches. We demonstrate once again the\nlimitation of MAP-Elites in uncertain domains and highlight the performance of\nthe existing Deep-Grid approach, and of our new algorithms. The goal of this\nframework and methods is to become an instrumental benchmark for future works\nconsidering Uncertain QD.",

We have recently shown that based on the concept of\n``Excess of Passivity (EoP),\" from nonlinear control theory, it is possible to\ndecode such energetic behavior for both upper and lower limbs. The extracted\nknowledge can be used in the design of controllers for optimizing the\ntransparency and fidelity of force fields in human-robot interaction and in\nhaptic systems. In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the frequency\nbehavior of the passivity map for the upper limb when the muscle co-activation\nwas controlled in real-time through visual electromyographic feedback. Five\nhealthy subjects (age: 27 +\/- 5) were included in this study. The energetic\nbehavior was evaluated at two stimulation frequencies at eight interaction\ndirections over two controlled muscle co-activation levels. Electromyography\n(EMG) was captured using the Delsys Wireless Trigno system. Results showed a\ncorrelation between EMG and EoP, which was further altered by increasing the\nfrequency. The proposed energetic behavior is named the Geometric MyoPassivity\n(GMP) map.

For actions that involve objects colliding, we collect human\nannotations of the materials of these objects (e.g. a glass object being placed\non a wooden surface), which we verify from video, discarding ambiguities.\nOverall, Epic-Sounds includes 78.4k categorised segments of audible events and\nactions, distributed across 44 classes as well as 39.2k non-categorised\nsegments. We train and evaluate state-of-the-art audio recognition and\ndetection models on our dataset, for both audio-only and audio-visual methods.\nWe also conduct analysis on: the temporal overlap between audio events, the\ntemporal and label correlations between audio and visual modalities, the\nambiguities in annotating materials from audio-only input, the importance of\naudio-only labels and the limitations of current models to understand actions\nthat sound.

In this work, we introduce a new framework for sharing\nbehavioral policies across tasks, which can be used in addition to existing\nMTRL methods. The key idea is to improve each task's off-policy data collection\nby employing behaviors from other task policies. Selectively sharing helpful\nbehaviors acquired in one task to collect training data for another task can\nlead to higher-quality trajectories, leading to more sample-efficient MTRL.\nThus, we introduce a simple and principled framework called Q-switch mixture of\npolicies (QMP) that selectively shares behavior between different task policies\nby using the task's Q-function to evaluate and select useful shareable\nbehaviors. We theoretically analyze how QMP improves the sample efficiency of\nthe underlying RL algorithm. Our experiments show that QMP's behavioral policy\nsharing provides complementary gains over many popular MTRL algorithms and\noutperforms alternative ways to share behaviors in various manipulation,\nlocomotion, and navigation environments.

Their peculiarity stems from the many active extrinsic mechanisms\nthat contribute to their properties and from a continuously growing number of\nnovel intrinsic features. Partly because of their unconventional nature, basic\nquestions about these materials remain open and one may wonder about the\npertinence of some frequent theoretical assumptions. Aided by first-principles\nsimulations, here we show that, by adopting an original high-symmetry reference\nphase as the starting point of the analysis, we can develop a mathematically\nsimple and physically transparent treatment of the ferroelectric state of\nhafnia. The proposed approach describes hafnia as a uniaxial ferroic, as\nsuggested by recent studies of (woken-up) samples with well developed\npolarization. Also, it is compatible with the occurrence of polar soft modes\nand proper ferroelectric order. Further, our theory provides a straightforward\nand unified description of all low-energy polymorphs, shedding light into old\nquestions (e.g., the prevalence of the monoclinic ground state), pointing at\nexciting possibilities (e.g., an antiferroelastic behavior) and facilitating\nthe future development of perturbative theories (from Landau to\nsecond-principles potentials).

While many hardware\ndefenses have been proposed for each class of attacks, we show that those for\nconventional (non-speculative) cache timing channels do not work for all\nspeculative execution attacks, and vice versa. We maintain that a cache is not\nsecure unless it can defend against both of these major attack classes.\n  We propose a new methodology and framework for covering such relatively large\nattack surfaces to produce a Speculative and Timing Attack Resilient (STAR)\ncache subsystem. We use this to design two comprehensive secure cache\narchitectures, STAR-FARR and STAR-NEWS, that have very low performance\noverheads of 5.6% and 6.8%, respectively.

To provide a medical dataset\ndensely annotated by domain experts with annotations useful across multiple\ndisease processes, we developed SkinCon: a skin disease dataset densely\nannotated by dermatologists. SkinCon includes 3230 images from the Fitzpatrick\n17k dataset densely annotated with 48 clinical concepts, 22 of which have at\nleast 50 images representing the concept. The concepts used were chosen by two\ndermatologists considering the clinical descriptor terms used to describe skin\nlesions. Examples include \"plaque\", \"scale\", and \"erosion\".

        "abstract": "K-Neares Neighbors (KNN) and its variant weighted KNN (WKNN) have been\nexplored for years in both academy and industry to provide stable and reliable\nperformance in WiFi-based indoor positioning systems. Such algorithms estimate\nthe location of a given point based on the locality information from the\nselected nearest WiFi neighbors according to some distance metrics calculated\nfrom the combination of WiFi received signal strength (RSS). However, such a\nprocess does not consider the relational information among the given point,\nWiFi neighbors, and the WiFi access points (WAPs). Therefore, this study\nproposes a novel Deep Neighborhood Learning (DNL). The proposed DNL approach\nconverts the WiFi neighborhood to heterogeneous graphs, and utilizes deep graph\nlearning to extract better representation of the WiFi neighborhood to improve\nthe positioning accuracy. Experiments on 3 real industrial datasets collected\nfrom 3 mega shopping malls on 26 floors have shown that the proposed approach\ncan reduce the mean absolute positioning error by 10% to 50% in most of the\ncases. Specially, the proposed approach sharply reduces the root mean squared\npositioning error and 95\\% percentile positioning error, being more robust to\nthe outliers than conventional KNN and WKNN.",

        "abstract": "Sparse linear models are one of several core tools for interpretable machine\nlearning, a field of emerging importance as predictive models permeate\ndecision-making in many domains. Unfortunately, sparse linear models are far\nless flexible as functions of their input features than black-box models like\ndeep neural networks. With this capability gap in mind, we study a not-uncommon\nsituation where the input features dichotomize into two groups: explanatory\nfeatures, which are candidates for inclusion as variables in an interpretable\nmodel, and contextual features, which select from the candidate variables and\ndetermine their effects. This dichotomy leads us to the contextual lasso, a new\nstatistical estimator that fits a sparse linear model to the explanatory\nfeatures such that the sparsity pattern and coefficients vary as a function of\nthe contextual features. The fitting process learns this function\nnonparametrically via a deep neural network. To attain sparse coefficients, we\ntrain the network with a novel lasso regularizer in the form of a projection\nlayer that maps the network's output onto the space of $\\ell_1$-constrained\nlinear models. An extensive suite of experiments on real and synthetic data\nsuggests that the learned models, which remain highly transparent, can be\nsparser than the regular lasso without sacrificing the predictive power of a\nstandard deep neural network.",

In this\npaper, we propose All-in-One Perception Network (AOP-Net), a LiDAR-based\nmulti-task framework that combines 3D object detection and panoptic\nsegmentation. In this method, a dual-task 3D backbone is developed to extract\nboth panoptic- and detection-level features from the input LiDAR point cloud.\nAlso, a new 2D backbone that intertwines Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and\nconvolution layers is designed to further improve the detection task\nperformance. Finally, a novel module is proposed to guide the detection head by\nrecovering useful features discarded during down-sampling operations in the 3D\nbackbone. This module leverages estimated instance segmentation masks to\nrecover detailed information from each candidate object. The AOP-Net achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for published works on the nuScenes benchmark for\nboth 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation tasks. Also, experiments\nshow that our method easily adapts to and significantly improves the\nperformance of any BEV-based 3D object detection method.",

        "abstract": "Recent progress in scaling up large language models has shown impressive\ncapabilities in performing few-shot learning across a wide range of text-based\ntasks. However, a key limitation is that these language models fundamentally\nlack visual perception - a crucial attribute needed to extend these models to\nbe able to interact with the real world and solve vision tasks, such as in\nvisual-question answering and robotics. Prior works have largely connected\nimage to text through pretraining and\/or fine-tuning on curated image-text\ndatasets, which can be a costly and expensive process. In order to resolve this\nlimitation, we propose a simple yet effective approach called\nLanguage-Quantized AutoEncoder (LQAE), a modification of VQ-VAE that learns to\nalign text-image data in an unsupervised manner by leveraging pretrained\nlanguage models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Our main idea is to encode image as\nsequences of text tokens by directly quantizing image embeddings using a\npretrained language codebook. We then apply random masking followed by a BERT\nmodel, and have the decoder reconstruct the original image from BERT predicted\ntext token embeddings. By doing so, LQAE learns to represent similar images\nwith similar clusters of text tokens, thereby aligning these two modalities\nwithout the use of aligned text-image pairs. This enables few-shot image\nclassification with large language models (e.g., GPT-3) as well as linear\nclassification of images based on BERT text features. To the best of our\nknowledge, our work is the first work that uses unaligned images for multimodal\ntasks by leveraging the power of pretrained language models.",

The malicious usage of these face-swap\nvideos has caused wide concerns. The research community has been focusing on\nthe automatic detection of these fake videos, but the assessment of their\nvisual realism, as perceived by human eyes, is still an unexplored dimension.\nVisual realism assessment, or VRA, is essential for assessing the potential\nimpact that may be brought by a specific face-swap video, and it is also\nimportant as a quality assessment metric to compare different face-swap\nmethods.

The evaluations are based on a\nrecent competition dataset named DFGC 2022, which contains 1400 diverse\nface-swap videos that are annotated with Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) on visual\nrealism. Comprehensive experiment results using 11 models and 3 protocols are\nshown and discussed. We demonstrate the feasibility of devising effective VRA\nmodels for assessing face-swap videos and methods.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a spiking neural network (SNN) accelerator made using\nfully open-source EDA tools, process design kit (PDK), and memory macros\nsynthesized using OpenRAM. The chip is taped out in the 130 nm SkyWater process\nand integrates over 1 million synaptic weights, and offers a reprogrammable\narchitecture. It operates at a clock speed of 40 MHz, a supply of 1.8 V, uses a\nPicoRV32 core for control, and occupies an area of 33.3 mm^2. The throughput of\nthe accelerator is 48,262 images per second with a wallclock time of 20.72 us,\nat 56.8 GOPS\/W. The spiking neurons use hysteresis to provide an adaptive\nthreshold (i.e., a Schmitt trigger) which can reduce state instability. This\nresults in high performing SNNs across a range of benchmarks that remain\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art, full precision SNNs.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in masked image modeling (MIM) have made it a prevailing\nframework for self-supervised visual representation learning. The MIM\npretrained models, like most deep neural network methods, remain vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks, limiting their practical application, and this issue has\nreceived little research attention. In this paper, we investigate how this\npowerful self-supervised learning paradigm can provide adversarial robustness\nto downstream classifiers. During the exploration, we find that noisy image\nmodeling (NIM), a simple variant of MIM that adopts denoising as the pre-text\ntask, reconstructs noisy images surprisingly well despite severe corruption.\nMotivated by this observation, we propose an adversarial defense method,\nreferred to as De^3, by exploiting the pretrained decoder for denoising.\nThrough De^3, NIM is able to enhance adversarial robustness beyond providing\npretrained features. Furthermore, we incorporate a simple modification,\nsampling the noise scale hyperparameter from random distributions, and enable\nthe defense to achieve a better and tunable trade-off between accuracy and\nrobustness. Experimental results demonstrate that, in terms of adversarial\nrobustness, NIM is superior to MIM thanks to its effective denoising\ncapability. Moreover, the defense provided by NIM achieves performance on par\nwith adversarial training while offering the extra tunability advantage.

It has\nbeen hypothesized that lateralization has benefits that may counterbalance its\ncosts. Given that lateralization is ubiquitous, it likely has advantages that\ncan benefit artificial intelligence. In turn, lateralized artificial\nintelligent systems can be used as tools to advance the understanding of\nlateralization in biological intelligence. Recently lateralization has been\nincorporated into artificially intelligent systems to solve complex problems in\ncomputer vision and navigation domains. Here we describe and test two novel\nlateralized artificial intelligent systems that simultaneously represent and\naddress given problems at constituent and holistic levels. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that the lateralized systems outperformed state-of-the-art\nnon-lateralized systems in resolving complex problems. The advantages arise\nfrom the abilities, (i) to represent an input signal at both the constituent\nlevel and holistic level simultaneously, such that the most appropriate\nviewpoint controls the system; (ii) to avoid extraneous computations by\ngenerating excite and inhibit signals. The computational costs associated with\nthe lateralized AI systems are either less than the conventional AI systems or\ncountered by providing better solutions.",

Finally, a\nreinforcement fusion scheme embedded in a $V^{-}$-shape generation module is\nused to combine the hierarchical representations to generate the missing MRI\nparameter.

We find, in\ncontrast, that stress free pure hafnia does not become ferroelectric for any\nreasonable electric field. So we explain the wake up effect and stabilization\nof ferroelectric pure hafnia as coming from a combination of epitaxial strain\nunder applied electric field perpendicular to the film. We find that strain (or\ndoping) primarily destabilizes the baddeleyite structure, so that the\nantiferroelectric Pbcn and ferroelectric phases can form.",

In this work, we propose MOMA to distill from pre-trained MoCo\nand MAE in a self-supervised manner to collaborate the knowledge from both\nparadigms. We introduce three different mechanisms of knowledge transfer in the\npropsoed MOMA framework. : (1) Distill pre-trained MoCo to MAE. (2) Distill\npre-trained MAE to MoCo (3) Distill pre-trained MoCo and MAE to a random\ninitialized student. During the distillation, the teacher and the student are\nfed with original inputs and masked inputs, respectively. The learning is\nenabled by aligning the normalized representations from the teacher and the\nprojected representations from the student. This simple design leads to\nefficient computation with extremely high mask ratio and dramatically reduced\ntraining epochs, and does not require extra considerations on the distillation\ntarget. The experiments show MOMA delivers compact student models with\ncomparable performance to existing state-of-the-art methods, combining the\npower of both self-supervised learning paradigms.

        "abstract": "Robot person following (RPF) is a capability that supports many useful\nhuman-robot-interaction (HRI) applications. However, existing solutions to\nperson following often assume full observation of the tracked person. As a\nconsequence, they cannot track the person reliably under partial occlusion\nwhere the assumption of full observation is not satisfied. In this paper, we\nfocus on the problem of robot person following under partial occlusion caused\nby a limited field of view of a monocular camera. Based on the key insight that\nit is possible to locate the target person when one or more of his\/her joints\nare visible, we propose a method in which each visible joint contributes a\nlocation estimate of the followed person. Experiments on a public\nperson-following dataset show that, even under partial occlusion, the proposed\nmethod can still locate the person more reliably than the existing SOTA\nmethods. As well, the application of our method is demonstrated in real\nexperiments on a mobile robot.",

        "abstract": "Connectivity technology has shown great potentials in improving the safety\nand efficiency of transportation systems by providing information beyond the\nperception and prediction capabilities of individual vehicles. However, it is\nexpected that human-driven and autonomous vehicles, and connected and\nnon-connected vehicles need to share the transportation network during the\ntransition period to fully connected and automated transportation systems. Such\nmixed traffic scenarios significantly increase the complexity in analyzing\nsystem behavior and quantifying uncertainty for highly interactive scenarios,\ne.g., lane changing. It is even harder to ensure system safety when neural\nnetwork based planners are leveraged to further improve efficiency. In this\nwork, we propose a connectivity-enhanced neural network based lane changing\nplanner. By cooperating with surrounding connected vehicles in dynamic\nenvironment, our proposed planner will adapt its planned trajectory according\nto the analysis of a safe evasion trajectory. We demonstrate the strength of\nour planner design in improving efficiency and ensuring safety in various mixed\ntraffic scenarios with extensive simulations. We also analyze the system\nrobustness when the communication or coordination is not perfect.",

        "abstract": "Learning with multiple modalities is crucial for automated brain tumor\nsegmentation from magnetic resonance imaging data. Explicitly optimizing the\ncommon information shared among all modalities (e.g., by maximizing the total\ncorrelation) has been shown to achieve better feature representations and thus\nenhance the segmentation performance. However, existing approaches are\noblivious to partial common information shared by subsets of the modalities. In\nthis paper, we show that identifying such partial common information can\nsignificantly boost the discriminative power of image segmentation models. In\nparticular, we introduce a novel concept of partial common information mask\n(PCI-mask) to provide a fine-grained characterization of what partial common\ninformation is shared by which subsets of the modalities. By solving a masked\ncorrelation maximization and simultaneously learning an optimal PCI-mask, we\nidentify the latent microstructure of partial common information and leverage\nit in a self-attention module to selectively weight different feature\nrepresentations in multi-modal data. We implement our proposed framework on the\nstandard U-Net. Our experimental results on the Multi-modal Brain Tumor\nSegmentation Challenge (BraTS) datasets outperform those of state-of-the-art\nsegmentation baselines, with validation Dice similarity coefficients of 0.920,\n0.897, 0.837 for the whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor on\nBraTS-2020.",

It aims\nto infer knowledge for (the things at) unobserved locations using the data from\n(the things at) observed locations during a given time period of interest. This\nproblem essentially requires \\emph{inductive learning}. Once trained, the model\nshould be able to perform kriging for different locations including newly given\nones, without retraining. However, it is challenging to perform accurate\nkriging results because of the heterogeneous spatial relations and diverse\ntemporal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel inductive graph\nrepresentation learning model for spatio-temporal kriging. We first encode\nheterogeneous spatial relations between the unobserved and observed locations\nby their spatial proximity, functional similarity, and transition probability.\nBased on each relation, we accurately aggregate the information of most\ncorrelated observed locations to produce inductive representations for the\nunobserved locations, by jointly modeling their similarities and differences.\nThen, we design relation-aware gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks to\nadaptively capture the temporal correlations in the generated sequence\nrepresentations for each relation. Finally, we propose a multi-relation\nattention mechanism to dynamically fuse the complex spatio-temporal information\nat different time steps from multiple relations to compute the kriging output.\nExperimental results on three real-world datasets show that our proposed model\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently, and the advantage is more\nsignificant when there are fewer observed locations.

        "abstract": "The optimization of electrical circuits is a difficult and time-consuming\nprocess performed by experts, but also increasingly by sophisticated\nalgorithms. In this paper, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach is adapted to\noptimize a LLC converter at multiple operation points corresponding to\ndifferent output powers at high converter efficiency at different switching\nfrequencies. During a training period, the RL agent learns a problem specific\noptimization policy enabling optimizations for any objective and boundary\ncondition within a pre-defined range. The results show, that the trained RL\nagent is able to solve new optimization problems based on LLC converter\nsimulations using Fundamental Harmonic Approximation (FHA) within 50 tuning\nsteps for two operation points with power efficiencies greater than 90%.\nTherefore, this AI technique provides the potential to augment expert-driven\ndesign processes with data-driven strategy extraction in the field of power\nelectronics and beyond.",

These models are\ntrained with relatively large single-speaker professionally recorded audio,\ntypically extracted from audiobooks. Meanwhile, due to the scarcity of freely\navailable speech corpora of this kind, a larger gap exists in Arabic TTS\nresearch and development. Most of the existing freely available Arabic speech\ncorpora are not suitable for TTS training as they contain multi-speaker casual\nspeech with variations in recording conditions and quality, whereas the corpus\ncurated for speech synthesis are generally small in size and not suitable for\ntraining state-of-the-art end-to-end models. In a move towards filling this gap\nin resources, we present a speech corpus for Classical Arabic Text-to-Speech\n(ClArTTS) to support the development of end-to-end TTS systems for Arabic. The\nspeech is extracted from a LibriVox audiobook, which is then processed,\nsegmented, and manually transcribed and annotated. The final ClArTTS corpus\ncontains about 12 hours of speech from a single male speaker sampled at 40100\nkHz. In this paper, we describe the process of corpus creation and provide\ndetails of corpus statistics and a comparison with existing resources.\nFurthermore, we develop two TTS systems based on Grad-TTS and Glow-TTS and\nillustrate the performance of the resulting systems via subjective and\nobjective evaluations.

We first decouple the design\nvariables in the constraints following a penalty dual decomposition method, and\nthen apply an alternating gradient projection algorithm to achieve a stationary\nsolution to the reformulated optimization problem. The proposed algorithm\nnearly doubles the WSR compared to that achieved by a block-coordinate descent\n(BCD) based benchmark scheme.

        "abstract": "Recognizing already explored places (a.k.a. place recognition) is a\nfundamental task in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to enable\nrobot relocalization and loop closure detection. In topological SLAM the\nrecognition takes place by comparing a signature (or feature vector) associated\nto the current node with the signatures of the nodes in the known map. However,\nas the number of nodes increases, matching the current node signature against\nall the existing ones becomes inefficient and thwarts real-time navigation. In\nthis paper we propose a novel approach to pre-select a subset of map nodes for\nplace recognition. The map nodes are clustered during exploration and each\ncluster is associated with a region. The region labels become the prediction\ntargets of a deep neural network and, during navigation, only the nodes\nassociated with the regions predicted with high probability are considered for\nmatching. While the proposed technique can be integrated in different SLAM\napproaches, in this work we describe an effective integration with RTAB-Map (a\npopular framework for real-time topological SLAM) which allowed us to design\nand run several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness.

        "abstract": "Global surface water detection in very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite\nimagery can directly serve major applications such as refined flood mapping and\nwater resource assessment. Although achievements have been made in detecting\nsurface water in small-size satellite images corresponding to local geographic\nscales, datasets and methods suitable for mapping and analyzing global surface\nwater have yet to be explored. To encourage the development of this task and\nfacilitate the implementation of relevant applications, we propose the\nGLH-water dataset that consists of 250 satellite images and manually labeled\nsurface water annotations that are distributed globally and contain water\nbodies exhibiting a wide variety of types (e.g., rivers, lakes, and ponds in\nforests, irrigated fields, bare areas, and urban areas). Each image is of the\nsize 12,800 $\\times$ 12,800 pixels at 0.3 meter spatial resolution. To build a\nbenchmark for GLH-water, we perform extensive experiments employing\nrepresentative surface water detection models, popular semantic segmentation\nmodels, and ultra-high resolution segmentation models. Furthermore, we also\ndesign a strong baseline with the novel pyramid consistency loss (PCL) to\ninitially explore this challenge. Finally, we implement the cross-dataset and\npilot area generalization experiments, and the superior performance illustrates\nthe strong generalization and practical application of GLH-water.

        "abstract": "Multimodal hate detection, which aims to identify harmful content online such\nas memes, is crucial for building a wholesome internet environment. Previous\nwork has made enlightening exploration in detecting explicit hate remarks.\nHowever, most of their approaches neglect the analysis of implicit harm, which\nis particularly challenging as explicit text markers and demographic visual\ncues are often twisted or missing. The leveraged cross-modal attention\nmechanisms also suffer from the distributional modality gap and lack logical\ninterpretability. To address these semantic gaps issues, we propose TOT: a\ntopology-aware optimal transport framework to decipher the implicit harm in\nmemes scenario, which formulates the cross-modal aligning problem as solutions\nfor optimal transportation plans. Specifically, we leverage an optimal\ntransport kernel method to capture complementary information from multiple\nmodalities. The kernel embedding provides a non-linear transformation ability\nto reproduce a kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which reflects significance for\neliminating the distributional modality gap. Moreover, we perceive the topology\ninformation based on aligned representations to conduct bipartite graph path\nreasoning. The newly achieved state-of-the-art performance on two publicly\navailable benchmark datasets, together with further visual analysis,\ndemonstrate the superiority of TOT in capturing implicit cross-modal alignment.",

These methods always synthesize unseen features from attributes\nthrough a generative adversarial network to mitigate the bias towards seen\nclasses. However, they neglect the semantic information in the unlabeled unseen\ndata and thus fail to generate high-fidelity attribute-consistent unseen\nfeatures. To address this issue, we present a novel transductive ZSL method\nthat produces semantic attributes of the unseen data and imposes them on the\ngenerative process. In particular, we first train an attribute decoder that\nlearns the mapping from visual features to semantic attributes. Then, from the\nattribute decoder, we obtain pseudo-attributes of unlabeled data and integrate\nthem into the generative model, which helps capture the detailed differences\nwithin unseen classes so as to synthesize more discriminative features.\nExperiments on five standard benchmarks show that our method yields\nstate-of-the-art results for zero-shot learning.",

One of the crucial\naspects in the development of the precise timing gaseous detectors applicable\nin high-energy physics experiments is a modular design that enables large area\ncoverage. The first 19-channel multi-pad prototype with an active area of\napproximately 10 cm$^2$ suffered from degraded timing resolution due to the\nnon-uniformity of the preamplification gap. A new 100 cm$^2$ detector module\nwith 100 channels based on a rigid hybrid ceramic\/FR4 Micromegas board for\nimproved drift gap uniformity was developed. Initial measurements with 80 GeV\/c\nmuons showed improvements in timing response over measured pads and a time\nresolution below 25 ps. More recent measurements with a new thinner drift gap\ndetector module and newly developed RF pulse amplifiers show that the\nresolution can be enhanced to a level of 17~ps.

        "abstract": "Relation prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs) is a key research topic.\nDominant embedding-based methods mainly focus on the transductive setting and\nlack the inductive ability to generalize to new entities for inference.\nExisting methods for inductive reasoning mostly mine the connections between\nentities, i.e., relational paths, without considering the nature of head and\ntail entities contained in the relational context. This paper proposes a novel\nmethod that captures both connections between entities and the intrinsic nature\nof entities, by simultaneously aggregating RElational Paths and cOntext with a\nunified hieRarchical Transformer framework, namely REPORT. REPORT relies solely\non relation semantics and can naturally generalize to the fully-inductive\nsetting, where KGs for training and inference have no common entities. In the\nexperiments, REPORT performs consistently better than all baselines on almost\nall the eight version subsets of two fully-inductive datasets. Moreover. REPORT\nis interpretable by providing each element's contribution to the prediction\nresults.",

This paper audits eight widely used LLMs from\nthree major providers -- OpenAI, Google, and Meta -- to evaluate their ability\nto discern credible and high-quality information sources from low-credibility\nones. We find that while LLMs can rate most tested news outlets, larger models\nmore frequently refuse to provide ratings due to insufficient information,\nwhereas smaller models are more prone to hallucination in their ratings. For\nsources where ratings are provided, LLMs exhibit a high level of agreement\namong themselves (average Spearman's $\\rho = 0.81$), but their ratings align\nonly moderately with human expert evaluations (average $\\rho = 0.59$).\nAnalyzing news sources with different political leanings in the US, we observe\na liberal bias in credibility ratings yielded by all LLMs in default\nconfigurations. Additionally, assigning partisan identities to LLMs\nconsistently results in strong politically congruent bias in the ratings. These\nfindings have important implications for the use of LLMs in curating news and\npolitical information.",

Self-defense law provides a framework for analyzing tangible\nfailure scenarios that can inform the design of robots and their algorithms.\nStudying self-defense is particularly important for ground robots since they\noperate within public environments, where they can pose a legitimate threat to\nthe safety of nearby humans. Moreover, even if ground robots can guarantee\nhuman safety, the perception of a physical threat is sufficient to justify\nhuman self-defense against robots.

We establish how current U.S. self-defense law\ncan justify a human protecting themselves against a robot, discuss the current\nliterature on human attitudes toward robots, and analyze methods that have been\nproduced to allow robots to operate close to humans.

        "abstract": "Although pair trading is the simplest hedging strategy for an investor to\neliminate market risk, it is still a great challenge for reinforcement learning\n(RL) methods to perform pair trading as human expertise. It requires RL methods\nto make thousands of correct actions that nevertheless have no obvious\nrelations to the overall trading profit, and to reason over infinite states of\nthe time-varying market most of which have never appeared in history. However,\nexisting RL methods ignore the temporal connections between asset price\nmovements and the risk of the performed trading. These lead to frequent\ntradings with high transaction costs and potential losses, which barely reach\nthe human expertise level of trading. Therefore, we introduce CREDIT, a\nrisk-aware agent capable of learning to exploit long-term trading opportunities\nin pair trading similar to a human expert. CREDIT is the first to apply\nbidirectional GRU along with the temporal attention mechanism to fully consider\nthe temporal correlations embedded in the states, which allows CREDIT to\ncapture long-term patterns of the price movements of two assets to earn higher\nprofit. We also design the risk-aware reward inspired by the economic theory,\nthat models both the profit and risk of the tradings during the trading period.\nIt helps our agent to master pair trading with a robust trading preference that\navoids risky trading with possible high returns and losses.

        "abstract": "As advances in artificial intelligence enable increasingly capable\nlearning-based autonomous agents, it becomes more challenging for human\nobservers to efficiently construct a mental model of the agent's behaviour. In\norder to successfully deploy autonomous agents, humans should not only be able\nto understand the individual limitations of the agents but also have insight on\nhow they compare against one another. To do so, we need effective methods for\ngenerating human interpretable agent behaviour summaries. Single agent\nbehaviour summarization has been tackled in the past through methods that\ngenerate explanations for why an agent chose to pick a particular action at a\nsingle timestep. However, for complex tasks, a per-action explanation may not\nbe able to convey an agents global strategy. As a result, researchers have\nlooked towards multi-timestep summaries which can better help humans assess an\nagents overall capability. More recently, multi-step summaries have also been\nused for generating contrasting examples to evaluate multiple agents. However,\npast approaches have largely relied on unstructured search methods to generate\nsummaries and require agents to have a discrete action space. In this paper we\npresent an adaptive search method for efficiently generating contrasting\nbehaviour summaries with support for continuous state and action spaces. We\nperform a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the summaries for helping\nhumans discern the superior autonomous agent for a given task. Our results\nindicate that adaptive search can efficiently identify informative contrasting\nscenarios that enable humans to accurately select the better performing agent\nwith a limited observation time budget.",

While these\nmodels have numerous benefits across various sectors, they have also raised\nconcerns about the potential misuse of fake images and cast new pressures on\nfake image detection. In this work, we pioneer a systematic study on deepfake\ndetection generated by state-of-the-art diffusion models. Firstly, we conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of the performance of contrastive and\nclassification-based visual features, respectively extracted from CLIP-based\nmodels and ResNet or ViT-based architectures trained on image classification\ndatasets. Our results demonstrate that fake images share common low-level cues,\nwhich render them easily recognizable. Further, we devise a multimodal setting\nwherein fake images are synthesized by different textual captions, which are\nused as seeds for a generator. Under this setting, we quantify the performance\nof fake detection strategies and introduce a contrastive-based disentangling\nmethod that lets us analyze the role of the semantics of textual descriptions\nand low-level perceptual cues. Finally, we release a new dataset, called\nCOCOFake, containing about 1.2M images generated from the original COCO\nimage-caption pairs using two recent text-to-image diffusion models, namely\nStable Diffusion v1.4 and v2.0.",

In a preliminary experiment,\nwe show that recent deep self-supervised features are very effective for word\nsegmentation but require supervision for training the classification head.

Our approach relies on the observation that the\ntemporal gradient magnitude of the embeddings (i.e. the distance between the\nembeddings of subsequent frames) is typically minimal far from the boundaries\nand higher nearer the boundaries. We use a thresholding function on the\ntemporal gradient magnitude to define a psuedo-label for wordness. We train a\nlinear classifier, mapping the embedding of a single frame to the pseudo-label.\nFinally, we use the classifier score to predict whether a frame is a word or a\nboundary.

However, this progress\nposes security and privacy concerns, necessitating effective solutions for\ndistinguishing deepfake texts from human-written ones. Although prior works\nstudied humans' ability to detect deepfake texts, none has examined whether\n\"collaboration\" among humans improves the detection of deepfake texts. In this\nstudy, to address this gap of understanding on deepfake texts, we conducted\nexperiments with two groups: (1) nonexpert individuals from the AMT platform\nand (2) writing experts from the Upwork platform. The results demonstrate that\ncollaboration among humans can potentially improve the detection of deepfake\ntexts for both groups, increasing detection accuracies by 6.36% for non-experts\nand 12.76% for experts, respectively, compared to individuals' detection\naccuracies. We further analyze the explanations that humans used for detecting\na piece of text as deepfake text, and find that the strongest indicator of\ndeepfake texts is their lack of coherence and consistency. Our study provides\nuseful insights for future tools and framework designs to facilitate the\ncollaborative human detection of deepfake texts.

We verify that we can use those\nsparse concepts to well estimate all inference scores of the LLM on all\narbitrarily masking states of the input sentence. We also evaluate the\ntransferability of concepts encoded by an LLM and verify that symbolic concepts\nusually exhibit high transferability across similar input sentences.

In this paper, we identify\nthat the challenge in quantizing activations in LLMs arises from varying ranges\nacross channels, rather than solely the presence of outliers. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce a quantization method called RPTQ, which utilizes a\nreorder-based approach. By rearranging the channels and quantizing them in\nclusters, RPTQ effectively mitigates the impact of range differences between\nchannels. To minimize the overhead of the reorder operation, we fuse it into\nthe layer norm operation and weights in linear layers. In our experiments, RPTQ\nachieved a significant breakthrough by utilizing 3-bit activation in LLMs for\nthe first time, resulting in a substantial reduction in memory usage. For\ninstance, quantizing OPT-175b can lead to a memory consumption reduction of up\nto 80%.",

        "abstract": "Building extraction and height estimation are two important basic tasks in\nremote sensing image interpretation, which are widely used in urban planning,\nreal-world 3D construction, and other fields. Most of the existing research\nregards the two tasks as independent studies. Therefore the height information\ncannot be fully used to improve the accuracy of building extraction and vice\nversa. In this work, we combine the individuaL buIlding extraction and heiGHt\nestimation through a unified multiTask learning network (LIGHT) for the first\ntime, which simultaneously outputs a height map, bounding boxes, and a\nsegmentation mask map of buildings. Specifically, LIGHT consists of an instance\nsegmentation branch and a height estimation branch. In particular, so as to\neffectively unify multi-scale feature branches and alleviate feature spans\nbetween branches, we propose a Gated Cross Task Interaction (GCTI) module that\ncan efficiently perform feature interaction between branches. Experiments on\nthe DFC2023 dataset show that our LIGHT can achieve superior performance, and\nour GCTI module with ResNet101 as the backbone can significantly improve the\nperformance of multitask learning by 2.8% AP50 and 6.5% delta1, respectively.",

Observing this\nchallenge, we propose a general task-oriented pick-place framework that treats\nthe target task and operating environment as placing constraints into grasping\noptimization. Combined with existing grasp detectors, our framework is able to\ngenerate feasible grasps for different downstream tasks and adapt to\nenvironmental changes without time-consuming re-training processes. Moreover,\nthe framework can accept different definitions of placing constraints, so it is\neasy to integrate with other modules.

        "abstract": "The training of neural networks is a complex, high-dimensional, non-convex\nand noisy optimization problem whose theoretical understanding is interesting\nboth from an applicative perspective and for fundamental reasons. A core\nchallenge is to understand the geometry and topography of the landscape that\nguides the optimization. In this work, we employ standard Statistical Mechanics\nmethods, namely, phase-space exploration using Langevin dynamics, to study this\nlandscape for an over-parameterized fully connected network performing a\nclassification task on random data. Analyzing the fluctuation statistics, in\nanalogy to thermal dynamics at a constant temperature, we infer a clear\ngeometric description of the low-loss region. We find that it is a\nlow-dimensional manifold whose dimension can be readily obtained from the\nfluctuations. Furthermore, this dimension is controlled by the number of data\npoints that reside near the classification decision boundary. Importantly, we\nfind that a quadratic approximation of the loss near the minimum is\nfundamentally inadequate due to the exponential nature of the decision boundary\nand the flatness of the low-loss region. This causes the dynamics to sample\nregions with higher curvature at higher temperatures, while producing\nquadratic-like statistics at any given temperature. We explain this behavior by\na simplified loss model which is analytically tractable and reproduces the\nobserved fluctuation statistics.",

        "abstract": "Mathematical models for the generation of the action potential can improve\nthe understanding of physiological mechanisms that are consequence of the\nelectrical activity in neurons. In such models, some equations involving\nempirically obtained functions of the membrane potential are usually defined.\nThe best known of these models, the Hodgkin-Huxley model, is an example of this\nparadigm since it defines the conductances of ion channels in terms of the\nopening and closing rates of each type of gate present in the channels. These\nfunctions need to be derived from laboratory measurements that are often very\nexpensive and produce little data because they involve a time-space-independent\nmeasurement of the voltage in a single channel of the cell membrane. In this\nwork, we investigate the possibility of finding the Hodgkin-Huxley model's\nparametric functions using only two simple measurements (the membrane voltage\nas a function of time and the injected current that triggered that voltage) and\napplying Deep Learning methods to estimate these functions. This would result\nin an hybrid model of the action potential generation composed by the original\nHodgkin-Huxley equations and an Artificial Neural Network that requires a small\nset of easy-to-perform measurements to be trained. Experiments were carried out\nusing data generated from the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, and results show\nthat a simple two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) architecture trained on\na minimal amount of data can learn to model some of the fundamental proprieties\nof the action potential generation by estimating the model's rate functions.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the task of speech reconstruction from ultrasound tongue\nimages and optical lip videos recorded in a silent speaking mode, where people\nonly activate their intra-oral and extra-oral articulators without producing\nsound. This task falls under the umbrella of articulatory-to-acoustic\nconversion, and may also be refered to as a silent speech interface. We propose\nto employ a method built on pseudo target generation and domain adversarial\ntraining with an iterative training strategy to improve the intelligibility and\nnaturalness of the speech recovered from silent tongue and lip articulation.\nExperiments show that our proposed method significantly improves the\nintelligibility and naturalness of the reconstructed speech in silent speaking\nmode compared to the baseline TaLNet model. When using an automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) model to measure intelligibility, the word error rate (WER)\nof our proposed method decreases by over 15% compared to the baseline. In\naddition, our proposed method also outperforms the baseline on the\nintelligibility of the speech reconstructed in vocalized articulating mode,\nreducing the WER by approximately 10%.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing development of neuromorphic platforms and their related\nsoftware tools as well as the increasing scale of spiking neural network (SNN)\nmodels, there is a pressure for interoperable and scalable representations of\nnetwork state. In response to this, we discuss a parallel extension of a widely\nused format for efficiently representing sparse matrices, the compressed sparse\nrow (CSR), in the context of supporting the simulation and serialization of\nlarge-scale SNNs. Sparse matrices for graph adjacency structure provide a\nnatural fit for describing the connectivity of an SNN, and prior work in the\narea of parallel graph partitioning has developed the distributed CSR (dCSR)\nformat for storing and ingesting large graphs. We contend that organizing\nadditional network information, such as neuron and synapse state, in alignment\nwith its adjacency as dCSR provides a straightforward partition-based\ndistribution of network state. For large-scale simulations, this means each\nparallel process is only responsible for its own partition of state, which\nbecomes especially useful when the size of an SNN exceeds the memory resources\nof a single compute node. For potentially long-running simulations, this also\nenables network serialization to and from disk (e.g. for checkpoint\/restart\nfault-tolerant computing) to be performed largely independently between\nparallel processes. We also provide a potential implementation, and put it\nforward for adoption within the neural computing community.",

        "abstract": "Recently, multi-interest models, which extract interests of a user as\nmultiple representation vectors, have shown promising performances for\nsequential recommendation. However, none of existing multi-interest\nrecommendation models consider the Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization\nproblem, in which interest distribution may change. Considering multiple\ninterests of a user are usually highly correlated, the model has chance to\nlearn spurious correlations between noisy interests and target items. Once the\ndata distribution changes, the correlations among interests may also change,\nand the spurious correlations will mislead the model to make wrong predictions.\nTo tackle with above OOD generalization problem, we propose a novel\nmulti-interest network, named DEep Stable Multi-Interest Learning (DESMIL),\nwhich attempts to de-correlate the extracted interests in the model, and thus\nspurious correlations can be eliminated. DESMIL applies an attentive module to\nextract multiple interests, and then selects the most important one for making\nfinal predictions. Meanwhile, DESMIL incorporates a weighted correlation\nestimation loss based on Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), with\nwhich training samples are weighted, to minimize the correlations among\nextracted interests. Extensive experiments have been conducted under both OOD\nand random settings, and up to 36.8% and 21.7% relative improvements are\nachieved respectively.",

In this\nposition paper, we argue that anticipating unintended consequences of\ntechnology can be facilitated through creativity-enhancing interventions, such\nas by building on existing knowledge and insights from diverse stakeholders.\nUsing lessons learned from prior work on creativity-support tools, the HCI\ncommunity is uniquely equipped to design novel systems that aid in anticipating\nnegative unintended consequences of technology on society.",

        "abstract": "The energy transition has recently experienced a further acceleration. In\norder to make the integration of renewable energies as cost-effective, secure\nand sustainable as possible and to develop new paradigms for the energy system,\nmany energy system models have been developed in research in the past to\nevaluate the solutions. While model identification and dissemination of results\nare widely discussed in the literature, a detailed view of the methodology is\noften missing. This paper addresses this topic and proposes a methodology to\nbuild a comprehensive, publicly accessible database for modeling a multi-modal\nintegrated energy system. The focus hereby is dynamic modeling of low- and\nmedium-voltage grids consisting of prosumers, battery storages, heat pumps and\nelectric cars. In addition, a district heating network is parameterized to\nmatch the electricity grid. Modelica and the TransiEnt-Library serves as the\nmodeling tool. The methodology for creating the grid models is available via\nGitLab. A study case that uses the methodology to analyze the congestion\nsituation within a medium-voltage distribution grid is presented.",

However, there are different levels of\nseverity of breast cancer requiring different treatment strategies, and hence,\ngrading breast cancer has become a vital component of breast cancer diagnosis\nand treatment planning. Specifically, the gold-standard Scarff-Bloom-Richardson\n(SBR) grade has been shown to consistently indicate a patient's response to\nchemotherapy. Unfortunately, the current method to determine the SBR grade\nrequires removal of some cancer cells from the patient which can lead to stress\nand discomfort along with costly expenses. In this paper, we study the efficacy\nof deep learning for breast cancer grading based on synthetic correlated\ndiffusion (CDI$^s$) imaging, a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality\nand found that it achieves better performance on SBR grade prediction compared\nto those learnt using gold-standard imaging modalities. Hence, we introduce\nCancer-Net BCa-S, a volumetric deep radiomics approach for predicting SBR grade\nbased on volumetric CDI$^s$ data. Given the promising results, this proposed\nmethod to identify the severity of the cancer would allow for better treatment\ndecisions without the need for a biopsy.

However, due to the lack of high-quality\nlabeled data, transcription of many instruments is still a challenging task.

In this paper, we propose\na method of finding note onsets of singing voice more accurately by leveraging\nthe linguistic characteristics of singing, which are not seen in other\ninstruments. The proposed model uses mel-scaled spectrogram and phonetic\nposteriorgram (PPG), a frame-wise likelihood of phoneme, as an input of the\nonset detection network while PPG is generated by the pre-trained network with\nsinging and speech data. To verify how linguistic features affect onset\ndetection, we compare the evaluation results through the dataset with different\nlanguages and divide onset types for detailed analysis.

        "abstract": "We experimentally investigate charge transport in In-GeTe and In-GeTe-In\nproximity devices, which are formed as junctions between superconducting indium\nleads and thick single crystal flakes of $\\alpha$-GeTe topological semimetal.\nWe observe nonmonotonic effects of the applied external magnetic field,\nincluding reentrant superconductivity in In-GeTe-In Josephson junctions:\nsupercurrent reappears at some finite magnetic field. For a single In-GeTe\nAndreev junction, the superconducting gap is partially suppressed in zero\nmagnetic field, while the gap is increased nearly to the bulk value for some\nfinite field before its full suppression. We discuss possible reasons for the\nresults obtained, taking into account spin polarization of Fermi arc surface\nstates in topological semimetal $\\alpha$-GeTe with a strong spin-orbit\ncoupling. In particular, the zero-field surface state spin polarization\npartially suppresses the superconductivity, while it is recovered due to the\nmodified spin-split surface state configuration in finite fields. As an\nalternative possible scenario, the transition into the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state is discussed. However, the role of\nstrong spin-orbit coupling in forming the nonmonotonic behavior has not been\nanalyzed for heterostructures in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state,\nwhich is crucial for junctions involving GeTe topological semimetal.",

        "abstract": "Medical decision-making processes can be enhanced by comprehensive biomedical\nknowledge bases, which require fusing knowledge graphs constructed from\ndifferent sources via a uniform index system. The index system often organizes\nbiomedical terms in a hierarchy to provide the aligned entities with\nfine-grained granularity. To address the challenge of scarce supervision in the\nbiomedical knowledge fusion (BKF) task, researchers have proposed various\nunsupervised methods. However, these methods heavily rely on ad-hoc lexical and\nstructural matching algorithms, which fail to capture the rich semantics\nconveyed by biomedical entities and terms. Recently, neural embedding models\nhave proved effective in semantic-rich tasks, but they rely on sufficient\nlabeled data to be adequately trained. To bridge the gap between the\nscarce-labeled BKF and neural embedding models, we propose HiPrompt, a\nsupervision-efficient knowledge fusion framework that elicits the few-shot\nreasoning ability of large language models through hierarchy-oriented prompts.\nEmpirical results on the collected KG-Hi-BKF benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of HiPrompt.",

        "abstract": "A new approach called NAF (the Neural Attention Forest) for solving\nregression and classification tasks under tabular training data is proposed.\nThe main idea behind the proposed NAF model is to introduce the attention\nmechanism into the random forest by assigning attention weights calculated by\nneural networks of a specific form to data in leaves of decision trees and to\nthe random forest itself in the framework of the Nadaraya-Watson kernel\nregression. In contrast to the available models like the attention-based random\nforest, the attention weights and the Nadaraya-Watson regression are\nrepresented in the form of neural networks whose weights can be regarded as\ntrainable parameters. The first part of neural networks with shared weights is\ntrained for all trees and computes attention weights of data in leaves. The\nsecond part aggregates outputs of the tree networks and aims to minimize the\ndifference between the random forest prediction and the truth target value from\na training set. The neural network is trained in an end-to-end manner. The\ncombination of the random forest and neural networks implementing the attention\nmechanism forms a transformer for enhancing the forest predictions. Numerical\nexperiments with real datasets illustrate the proposed method. The code\nimplementing the approach is publicly available.",

Since positive data is disproportionately\ncontributed by a minority of active users, negative samplers might be affected\nby data imbalance thus choosing more informative negative items for active\nusers. Consequently, users with low participation are further underrepresented\nin the training data, potentially causing subpar treatment from recommenders.\nIn this paper we demonstrate empirically that active users receive more\naccurate recommendation than inactive users for state-of-the-art negative\nsampling strategies, and the degree of data imbalance influences the severity\nof performance disparities. We further show that the performance gain brought\nby sampling more negative instances for each positive item is unequally\ndistributed across user groups. Generally, active users benefit from\nperformance gain whereas inactive users might suffer from performance\ndegradation. To address these shortcomings, we propose a group-wise negative\nratio setup where we use the appropriate smaller negative ratio for inactive\nusers and a bigger ratio for active users.

        "title": "Harnessing Digital Pathology And Causal Learning To Improve Eosinophilic Esophagitis Dietary Treatment Assignment",
        "abstract": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, food antigen-driven, allergic\ninflammatory condition of the esophagus associated with elevated esophageal\neosinophils. EoE is a top cause of chronic dysphagia after GERD. Diagnosis of\nEoE relies on counting eosinophils in histological slides, a manual and\ntime-consuming task that limits the ability to extract complex\npatient-dependent features. The treatment of EoE includes medication and food\nelimination. A personalized food elimination plan is crucial for engagement and\nefficiency, but previous attempts failed to produce significant results. In\nthis work, on the one hand, we utilize AI for inferring histological features\nfrom the entire biopsy slide, features that cannot be extracted manually. On\nthe other hand, we develop causal learning models that can process this wealth\nof data. We applied our approach to the 'Six-Food vs. One-Food Eosinophilic\nEsophagitis Diet Study', where 112 symptomatic adults aged 18-60 years with\nactive EoE were assigned to either a six-food elimination diet (6FED) or a\none-food elimination diet (1FED) for six weeks. Our results show that the\naverage treatment effect (ATE) of the 6FED treatment compared with the 1FED\ntreatment is not significant, that is, neither diet was superior to the other.\nWe examined several causal models and show that the best treatment strategy was\nobtained using T-learner with two XGBoost modules. While 1FED only and 6FED\nonly provide improvement for 35%-38% of the patients, which is not\nsignificantly different from a random treatment assignment, our causal model\nyields a significantly better improvement rate of 58.4%. This study illustrates\nthe significance of AI in enhancing treatment planning by analyzing molecular\nfeatures' distribution in histological slides through causal learning. Our\napproach can be harnessed for other conditions that rely on histology for\ndiagnosis and treatment.",

        "abstract": "In inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions, mixing the ablator into the\nfuel and the hot spot is one of the most adverse factors that lead to ignition\ndegradation. Recent experiments in the Marble campaign at the Omega laser\nfacility and the National Ignition Facility (NIF) demonstrate the significance\nof the temperature separation in heterogeneous mixing flows. In the present\nwork we provide an approach to deal with thermally disequilibrium\nmulti-component flows with the ultimate aim to investigate the temperature\nseparation impact on mixing and fusion burn. The present work is two-fold,\ni.e., (a)we derive a model governing the multi-component flows in thermal\ndisequilibrium with transport terms, (b)we use the derived model to study the\nRayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability in thermally relaxing multi-component systems.\nThe model is reduced from the fully disequilibrium multi-phase Baer-Nunziato\nmodel in the limit of small Knudsen number $Kn << 1$. Velocity disequilibrium\nis closed with the diffusion laws and only one mass weighted velocity is\nretained formally. Thus, the complex wave structure of the original\nBaer-Nunziato model is simplified to a large extent and the obtained model is\nmuch more computationally affordable. Moreover, the capability to deal with\nfinite temperature relaxation is kept. Efficient numerical methods for solving\nthe proposed model are aslo presented. Equipped with the proposed model and\nnumerical methods, we further investigate the impact of the thermal relaxation\non the RT instability development at the inertial confinement fusion (ICF)\ndeceleration stage. On the basis of numerical simulations, we have found that\nfor the RT instability at an interface between the high-density low-temperature\ncomponent and the low-density high-temperature component, the thermal\nrelaxation significantly suppress the development of the instability.",

        "abstract": "Modern neural-network-based speech processing systems are typically required\nto be robust against reverberation, and the training of such systems thus needs\na large amount of reverberant data. During the training of the systems,\non-the-fly simulation pipeline is nowadays preferred as it allows the model to\ntrain on infinite number of data samples without pre-generating and saving them\non harddisk. An RIR simulation method thus needs to not only generate more\nrealistic artificial room impulse response (RIR) filters, but also generate\nthem in a fast way to accelerate the training process. Existing RIR simulation\ntools have proven effective in a wide range of speech processing tasks and\nneural network architectures, but their usage in on-the-fly simulation pipeline\nremains questionable due to their computational complexity or the quality of\nthe generated RIR filters. In this paper, we propose FRAM-RIR, a fast random\napproximation method of the widely-used image-source method (ISM), to\nefficiently generate realistic multi-channel RIR filters. FRAM-RIR bypasses the\nexplicit calculation of sound propagation paths in ISM-based algorithms by\nrandomly sampling the location and number of reflections of each virtual sound\nsource based on several heuristic assumptions, while still maintains accurate\ndirection-of-arrival (DOA) information of all sound sources. Visualization of\noracle beampatterns and directional features shows that FRAM-RIR can generate\nmore realistic RIR filters than existing widely-used ISM-based tools, and\nexperiment results on multi-channel noisy speech separation and dereverberation\ntasks with a wide range of neural network architectures show that models\ntrained with FRAM-RIR can also achieve on par or better performance on real\nRIRs compared to other RIR simulation tools with a significantly accelerated\ntraining procedure.

        "abstract": "Federated learning allows for the training of machine learning models on\nmultiple decentralized local datasets without requiring explicit data exchange.\nHowever, data pre-processing, including strategies for handling missing data,\nremains a major bottleneck in real-world federated learning deployment, and is\ntypically performed locally. This approach may be biased, since the\nsubpopulations locally observed at each center may not be representative of the\noverall one. To address this issue, this paper first proposes a more consistent\napproach to data standardization through a federated model. Additionally, we\npropose Fed-MIWAE, a federated version of the state-of-the-art imputation\nmethod MIWAE, a deep latent variable model for missing data imputation based on\nvariational autoencoders. MIWAE has the great advantage of being easily\ntrainable with classical federated aggregators. Furthermore, it is able to deal\nwith MAR (Missing At Random) data, a more challenging missing-data mechanism\nthan MCAR (Missing Completely At Random), where the missingness of a variable\ncan depend on the observed ones. We evaluate our method on multi-modal medical\nimaging data and clinical scores from a simulated federated scenario with the\nADNI dataset. We compare Fed-MIWAE with respect to classical imputation\nmethods, either performed locally or in a centralized fashion. Fed-MIWAE allows\nto achieve imputation accuracy comparable with the best centralized method,\neven when local data distributions are highly heterogeneous. In addition,\nthanks to the variational nature of Fed-MIWAE, our method is designed to\nperform multiple imputation, allowing for the quantification of the imputation\nuncertainty in the federated scenario.",

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, audio coding technology has seen standardization and\nthe development of many frameworks incorporated with linear predictive coding\n(LPC). As LPC reduces information in the frequency domain, LP-based\nfrequency-domain noise-shaping (FDNS) was previously proposed. To code\ntransient signals effectively, FDNS with temporal noise shaping (TNS) has\nemerged. However, these mainly operated in the modified discrete cosine\ntransform domain, which essentially accompanies time domain aliasing. In this\npaper, a unified noise-shaping (UNS) framework including FDNS and complex\nLPC-based TNS (CTNS) in the DFT domain is proposed to overcome the aliasing\nissues. Additionally, a modified polar quantizer with phase contrast control is\nproposed, which saves phase bits depending on the frequency envelope\ninformation. The core coding feasibility at low bit rates is verified through\nvarious objective metrics and subjective listening evaluations.",

        "abstract": "Suggesting complementary clothing items to compose an outfit is a process of\nemerging interest, yet it involves a fine understanding of fashion trends and\nvisual aesthetics. Previous works have mainly focused on recommendation by\nscoring visual appeal and representing garments as ordered sequences or as\ncollections of pairwise-compatible items. This limits the full usage of\nrelations among clothes. We attempt to bridge the gap between outfit\nrecommendation and generation by leveraging a graph-based representation of\nitems in a collection. The work carried out in this paper, tries to build a\nbridge between outfit recommendation and generation, by discovering new\nappealing outfits starting from a collection of pre-existing ones. We propose a\ntransformer-based architecture, named TGNN, which exploits multi-headed self\nattention to capture relations between clothing items in a graph as a message\npassing step in Convolutional Graph Neural Networks. Specifically, starting\nfrom a seed, i.e.~one or more garments, outfit generation is performed by\niteratively choosing the garment that is most compatible with the previously\nchosen ones. Extensive experimentations are conducted with two different\ndatasets, demonstrating the capability of the model to perform seeded outfit\ngeneration as well as obtaining state of the art results on compatibility\nestimation tasks.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain has been used in several domains. However, this technology still\nhas major limitations that are largely related to one of its core components,\nnamely the consensus protocol\/algorithm. Several solutions have been proposed\nin literature and some of them are based on the use of Machine Learning (ML)\nmethods. The ML-based consensus algorithms usually waste the work done by the\n(contributing\/participating) nodes, as only winners' ML models are\nconsidered\/used, resulting in low energy efficiency. To reduce energy waste and\nimprove scalability, this paper proposes an AI-enabled consensus algorithm\n(named AICons) driven by energy preservation and fairness of rewarding nodes\nbased on their contribution. In particular, the local ML models trained by all\nnodes are utilised to generate a global ML model for selecting winners, which\nreduces energy waste. Considering the fairness of the rewards, we innovatively\ndesigned a utility function for the Shapley value evaluation equation to\nevaluate the contribution of each node from three aspects, namely ML model\naccuracy, energy consumption, and network bandwidth. The three aspects are\ncombined into a single Shapley value to reflect the contribution of each node\nin a blockchain system. Extensive experiments were carried out to evaluate\nfairness, scalability, and profitability of the proposed solution. In\nparticular, AICons has an evenly distributed reward-contribution ratio across\nnodes, handling 38.4 more transactions per second, and allowing nodes to get\nmore profit to support a bigger network than the state-of-the-art schemes.",

        "abstract": "As the rapid development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) in the past\ndecade, tracing the students' knowledge state has become more and more\nimportant in order to provide individualized learning guidance. This is the\nmain idea of Knowledge Tracing (KT), which models students' mastery of\nknowledge concepts (KCs, skills needed to solve a question) based on their past\ninteractions on platforms. Plenty of KT models have been proposed and have\nshown remarkable performance recently. However, the majority of these models\nuse concepts to index questions, which means the predefined skill tags for each\nquestion are required in advance to indicate the KCs needed to answer that\nquestion correctly. This makes it pretty hard to apply on large-scale online\neducation platforms where questions are often not well-organized by skill tags.\nIn this paper, we propose Q-matrix-based Attentive Knowledge Tracing (QAKT), an\nend-to-end style model that is able to apply the attentive method to scenes\nwhere no predefined skill tags are available without sacrificing its\nperformance. With a novel hybrid embedding method based on the q-matrix and\nRasch model, QAKT is capable of modeling problems hierarchically and learning\nthe q-matrix efficiently based on students' sequences. Meanwhile, the\narchitecture of QAKT ensures that it is friendly to questions associated with\nmultiple skills and has outstanding interpretability. After conducting\nexperiments on a variety of open datasets, we empirically validated that our\nmodel shows similar or even better performance than state-of-the-art KT\nmethods. Results of further experiments suggest that the q-matrix learned by\nQAKT is highly model-agnostic and more information-sufficient than the one\nlabeled by human experts, which could help with the data mining tasks in\nexisting ITSs.",

We demonstrate that optical N-plasmons exhibit\nfundamentally different dispersion relations, stability, and edge profiles from\nthe topologically trivial edge magneto plasmons. Based on the optical\nN-plasmon, we design an ultra sub-wavelength broadband topological hydrodynamic\ncirculator, which is a chiral quantum radio-frequency circuit component crucial\nfor information routing and interfacing quantum-classical computing systems.\nFurthermore, we reveal that optical N-plasmons can be effectively tuned by the\nneighboring dielectric environment without breaking the topological properties.\nOur work provides a smoking gun signature of repulsive Hall viscosity and opens\npractical applications of topological electromagnetic phases of two-dimensional\nmaterials.",

        "abstract": "Accurately estimating gas usage is essential for the efficient functioning of\ngas distribution networks and saving operational costs. Traditional methods\nrely on centralized data processing, which poses privacy risks. Federated\nlearning (FL) offers a solution to this problem by enabling local data\nprocessing on each participant, such as gas companies and heating stations.\nHowever, local training and communication overhead may discourage gas companies\nand heating stations from actively participating in the FL training process. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical FL Incentive Mechanism for\nGas Usage Estimation (HI-GAS), which has been testbedded in the ENN Group, one\nof the leading players in the natural gas and green energy industry. It is\ndesigned to support horizontal FL among gas companies, and vertical FL among\neach gas company and heating station within a hierarchical FL ecosystem,\nrewarding participants based on their contributions to FL. In addition, a\nhierarchical FL model aggregation approach is also proposed to improve the gas\nusage estimation performance by aggregating models at different levels of the\nhierarchy. The incentive scheme employs a multi-dimensional contribution-aware\nreward distribution function that combines the evaluation of data quality and\nmodel contribution to incentivize both gas companies and heating stations\nwithin their jurisdiction while maintaining fairness.

Previous experiments in robotic chemistry have performed high\nnumbers of experiments autonomously, however, these processes rely on automated\nmachines in all stages from solid or liquid addition to analysis of the final\nproduct. In these systems every transition between machine requires the robotic\nchemist to pick and place glass vials, however, this is currently performed\nusing open loop methods which require all equipment being used by the robot to\nbe in well defined known locations. We seek to begin closing the loop in this\nvial handling process in a way which also fosters human-robot collaboration in\nthe chemistry lab environment. To do this the robot must be able to detect\nvalid placement positions for the vials it is collecting, and reliably insert\nthem into the detected locations. We create a single modality visual method for\nestimating placement locations to provide a baseline before introducing two\nadditional methods of feedback (force and tactile feedback). Our visual method\nuses a combination of classic computer vision methods and a CNN discriminator\nto detect possible insertion points, then a vial is grasped and positioned\nabove an insertion point and the multi-modal methods guide the final insertion\nmovements using an efficient search pattern. Through our experiments we show\nthe baseline insertion rate of 48.78% improves to 89.55% with the addition of\nour \"force and vision\" multi-modal feedback method.",

        "abstract": "Suspensions of anisotropic particles are commonly encountered in a wide\nspectrum of applications, including industrial and architectural coatings,\ntargeted drug delivery and manufacturing of fiber-reinforced composites. A\ngrand challenge in the field of chemical and material processing is robust\nproduction of strongly aligned fibers at the microscopic level, as this is\nroutinely linked with enhanced mechanical properties at the macroscopic level.\nWhile the investigation of the microstructure of anisotropic colloids in shear\nflows has garnered a lot of theoretical and experimental attention, the case of\nextensional flow remains poorly understood due to several experimental\nchallenges. In this article, we present a theoretical framework for predicting\nthe steady and transient orientations of anisotropic particles in a flowing\nliquid undergoing precisely defined steady and time-dependent planar\nextensional flow at the stagnation point of a Stokes trap device. In\nparticular, we analytically solve the Fokker-Planck equation for estimating the\nprobability distribution function describing the orientation dynamics of\nrod-like objects as a function of flow strength (Peclet number, Pe) and probing\nfrequency (Deborah number, De). The theoretical results are compared with\nrecent experiments and reasonable agreement is found. We also discuss the\nchallenges involved in obtaining a full closed-form solution for the transient\ndynamics of anisotropic particles in oscillatory time-dependent extensional\nflow. Overall, our theoretical framework provides a way to compare the\norientation dynamics of rod-like particles with experiments that have been\nperformed using a new experimental technique involving the Stokes trap and\nprecise flow-control over the orientation of particles.",

        "abstract": "The rapidly evolving communication landscape, with the advent of 6G\ntechnology, brings new challenges to the design and operation of wireless\nnetworks. One of the key concerns is the energy efficiency of the Radio Access\nNetwork (RAN), as the exponential growth in wireless traffic demands\nincreasingly higher energy consumption. In this paper, we assess the potential\nof integrating a High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) to improve the energy\nefficiency of a RAN, and quantify the potential energy conservation through\nmeticulously designed simulations. We propose a quantitative framework based on\nreal traffic patterns to estimate the energy consumption of the HAPS integrated\nRAN and compare it with the conventional terrestrial RAN. Our simulation\nresults elucidate that HAPS can significantly reduce energy consumption by up\nto almost 30\\% by exploiting the unique advantages of HAPS, such as its\nself-sustainability, high altitude, and wide coverage. We further analyze the\nimpact of different system parameters on performance, and provide insights for\nthe design and optimization of future 6G networks. Our work sheds light on the\npotential of HAPS integrated RAN to mitigate the energy challenges in the 6G\nera, and contributes to the sustainable development of wireless communications.",

        "abstract": "Polygonal meshes have become the standard for discretely approximating 3D\nshapes, thanks to their efficiency and high flexibility in capturing\nnon-uniform shapes. This non-uniformity, however, leads to irregularity in the\nmesh structure, making tasks like segmentation of 3D meshes particularly\nchallenging. Semantic segmentation of 3D mesh has been typically addressed\nthrough CNN-based approaches, leading to good accuracy. Recently, transformers\nhave gained enough momentum both in NLP and computer vision fields, achieving\nperformance at least on par with CNN models, supporting the long-sought\narchitecture universalism. Following this trend, we propose a transformer-based\nmethod for semantic segmentation of 3D mesh motivated by a better modeling of\nthe graph structure of meshes, by means of global attention mechanisms. In\norder to address the limitations of standard transformer architectures in\nmodeling relative positions of non-sequential data, as in the case of 3D\nmeshes, as well as in capturing the local context, we perform positional\nencoding by means the Laplacian eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, replacing\nthe traditional sinusoidal positional encodings, and by introducing\nclustering-based features into the self-attention and cross-attention\noperators. Experimental results, carried out on three sets of the Shape COSEG\nDataset, on the human segmentation dataset proposed in Maron et al., 2017 and\non the ShapeNet benchmark, show how the proposed approach yields\nstate-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation of 3D meshes.",

        "abstract": "Extended Asynchronous DRAM Refresh (eADR) proposed by Intel extends the\npersistence domain from the Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) to CPU caches and offers\nthe persistence guarantee. Due to allowing lazy persistence and decreasing the\namounts of instructions, eADR-based NVM systems significantly improve\nperformance. Existing designs however fail to provide efficient encryption\nschemes to ensure data confidentiality in eADR-based NVM systems. It is\nchallenging to guarantee both data persistence and confidentiality in a\ncost-efficient manner due to the transient persistence property of caches in\neADR. Once the system crashes, eADR flushes the unencrypted data from the cache\ninto NVM, in which security issues occur due to no encryption. To bridge the\ngap between persistence and confidentiality, we propose cost-efficient BBE and\nSepencr encryption schemes that efficiently match different eADR execution\nmodels from ideal to practice. Under the ideal eADR execution model, BBE\nsupports the encryption module via the battery of eADR upon crashes. Under the\npractical eADR execution model, Sepencr generates the one-time paddings (OTPs)\nat the system startup to encrypt the cached data in case the system crashes.\nOur evaluation results show that compared with an intuitive in-cache encryption\nscheme in eADR-based systems, our designs significantly reduce performance\noverheads while efficiently ensuring data confidentiality.",

        "abstract": "Despite the broad application of Machine Learning models as a Service\n(MLaaS), they are vulnerable to model stealing attacks. These attacks can\nreplicate the model functionality by using the black-box query process without\nany prior knowledge of the target victim model. Existing stealing defenses add\ndeceptive perturbations to the victim's posterior probabilities to mislead the\nattackers. However, these defenses are now suffering problems of high inference\ncomputational overheads and unfavorable trade-offs between benign accuracy and\nstealing robustness, which challenges the feasibility of deployed models in\npractice. To address the problems, this paper proposes Isolation and Induction\n(InI), a novel and effective training framework for model stealing defenses.\nInstead of deploying auxiliary defense modules that introduce redundant\ninference time, InI directly trains a defensive model by isolating the\nadversary's training gradient from the expected gradient, which can effectively\nreduce the inference computational cost. In contrast to adding perturbations\nover model predictions that harm the benign accuracy, we train models to\nproduce uninformative outputs against stealing queries, which can induce the\nadversary to extract little useful knowledge from victim models with minimal\nimpact on the benign performance. Extensive experiments on several visual\nclassification datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR10) demonstrate the superior\nrobustness (up to 48% reduction on stealing accuracy) and speed (up to 25.4x\nfaster) of our InI over other state-of-the-art methods.

In particular, we aim to minimize the delivery latency\nof HARQ schemes over time-correlated fading channels, meanwhile ensuring the\nhigh reliability and limited power consumption. To ease the optimization, the\nsimple asymptotic outage expressions of HARQ schemes are adopted. Furthermore,\nby noticing the non-convexity of the latency minimization problem and the\nintricate connection between different HARQ rounds, the graph convolutional\nnetwork (GCN) is invoked for the optimal power solution owing to its powerful\nability of handling the graph data. The primal-dual learning method is then\nleveraged to train the GCN weights. Consequently, the numerical results are\npresented for verification together with the comparisons among three HARQ\nschemes in terms of the latency and the reliability, where the three HARQ\nschemes include Type-I HARQ, HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC), and HARQ with\nincremental redundancy (HARQ-IR).

        "abstract": "The complex transmission mechanism of cross-packet hybrid automatic repeat\nrequest (XP-HARQ) hinders its optimal system design. To overcome this\ndifficulty, this letter attempts to use the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nto solve the rate selection problem of XP-HARQ over correlated fading channels.\nIn particular, the long term average throughput (LTAT) is maximized by properly\nchoosing the incremental information rate for each HARQ round on the basis of\nthe outdated channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter. The\nrate selection problem is first converted into a Markov decision process (MDP),\nwhich is then solved by capitalizing on the algorithm of deep deterministic\npolicy gradient (DDPG) with prioritized experience replay. The simulation\nresults finally corroborate the superiority of the proposed XP-HARQ scheme over\nthe conventional HARQ with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) and the XP-HARQ\nwith only statistical CSI.",

When the TIE successfully finds task-related information from\nthe preceding chit-chat, such as a transition domain, then the TSG is activated\nautomatically in the unified model to initiate this transition by generating a\ntransition sentence under the guidance of transition information extracted by\nTIE. The experimental results show promising performance regarding the\nproactive transitions. We achieve an additional large improvement on TIE model\nby utilizing Conditional Random Fields (CRF).

        "abstract": "Optics is an exciting route for the next generation of computing hardware for\nmachine learning, promising several orders of magnitude enhancement in both\ncomputational speed and energy efficiency. However, to reach the full capacity\nof an optical neural network it is necessary that the computing not only for\nthe inference, but also for the training be implemented optically. The primary\nalgorithm for training a neural network is backpropagation, in which the\ncalculation is performed in the order opposite to the information flow for\ninference. While straightforward in a digital computer, optical implementation\nof backpropagation has so far remained elusive, particularly because of the\nconflicting requirements for the optical element that implements the nonlinear\nactivation function. In this work, we address this challenge for the first time\nwith a surprisingly simple and generic scheme. Saturable absorbers are employed\nfor the role of the activation units, and the required properties are achieved\nthrough a pump-probe process, in which the forward propagating signal acts as\nthe pump and backward as the probe. Our approach is adaptable to various analog\nplatforms, materials, and network structures, and it demonstrates the\npossibility of constructing neural networks entirely reliant on analog optical\nprocesses for both training and inference tasks.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dominated the synthetic aperture\nradar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) for years. However, under the\nlimited SAR images, the width and depth of the CNN-based models are limited,\nand the widening of the received field for global features in images is\nhindered, which finally leads to the low performance of recognition. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a Convolutional Transformer (ConvT) for SAR ATR\nfew-shot learning (FSL). The proposed method focuses on constructing a\nhierarchical feature representation and capturing global dependencies of local\nfeatures in each layer, named global in local. A novel hybrid loss is proposed\nto interpret the few SAR images in the forms of recognition labels and\ncontrastive image pairs, construct abundant anchor-positive and anchor-negative\nimage pairs in one batch and provide sufficient loss for the optimization of\nthe ConvT to overcome the few sample effect. An auto augmentation is proposed\nto enhance and enrich the diversity and amount of the few training samples to\nexplore the hidden feature in a few SAR images and avoid the over-fitting in\nSAR ATR FSL. Experiments conducted on the Moving and Stationary Target\nAcquisition and Recognition dataset (MSTAR) have shown the effectiveness of our\nproposed ConvT for SAR ATR FSL.

        "abstract": "As one of the energy-efficient alternatives of conventional neural networks\n(CNNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained more and more interest\nrecently. To train the deep models, some effective batch normalization (BN)\ntechniques are proposed in SNNs. All these BNs are suggested to be used after\nthe convolution layer as usually doing in CNNs. However, the spiking neuron is\nmuch more complex with the spatio-temporal dynamics. The regulated data flow\nafter the BN layer will be disturbed again by the membrane potential updating\noperation before the firing function, i.e., the nonlinear activation.\nTherefore, we advocate adding another BN layer before the firing function to\nnormalize the membrane potential again, called MPBN. To eliminate the induced\ntime cost of MPBN, we also propose a training-inference-decoupled\nre-parameterization technique to fold the trained MPBN into the firing\nthreshold. With the re-parameterization technique, the MPBN will not introduce\nany extra time burden in the inference. Furthermore, the MPBN can also adopt\nthe element-wised form, while these BNs after the convolution layer can only\nuse the channel-wised form. Experimental results show that the proposed MPBN\nperforms well on both popular non-spiking static and neuromorphic datasets.

        "title": "Temporal Interest Network for User Response Prediction",
        "abstract": "User response prediction is essential in industrial recommendation systems,\nsuch as online display advertising. Among all the features in recommendation\nmodels, user behaviors are among the most critical. Many works have revealed\nthat a user's behavior reflects her interest in the candidate item, owing to\nthe semantic or temporal correlation between behaviors and the candidate. While\nthe literature has individually examined each of these correlations,\nresearchers have yet to analyze them in combination, that is, the\nsemantic-temporal correlation. We empirically measure this correlation and\nobserve intuitive yet robust patterns. We then examine several popular user\ninterest models and find that, surprisingly, none of them learn such\ncorrelation well.\n  To fill this gap, we propose a Temporal Interest Network (TIN) to capture the\nsemantic-temporal correlation simultaneously between behaviors and the target.\nWe achieve this by incorporating target-aware temporal encoding, in addition to\nsemantic encoding, to represent behaviors and the target. Furthermore, we\nconduct explicit 4-way interaction by deploying target-aware attention and\ntarget-aware representation to capture both semantic and temporal correlation.\nWe conduct comprehensive evaluations on two popular public datasets, and our\nproposed TIN outperforms the best-performing baselines by 0.43% and 0.29% on\nGAUC, respectively. During online A\/B testing in Tencent's advertising\nplatform, TIN achieves 1.65% cost lift and 1.93% GMV lift over the base model.\nIt has been successfully deployed in production since October 2023, serving the\nWeChat Moments traffic. We have released our code at\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/zhouxy1003\/TIN.",

        "title": "Attention Calibration for Transformer-based Sequential Recommendation",
        "abstract": "Transformer-based sequential recommendation (SR) has been booming in recent\nyears, with the self-attention mechanism as its key component. Self-attention\nhas been widely believed to be able to effectively select those informative and\nrelevant items from a sequence of interacted items for next-item prediction via\nlearning larger attention weights for these items. However, this may not always\nbe true in reality. Our empirical analysis of some representative\nTransformer-based SR models reveals that it is not uncommon for large attention\nweights to be assigned to less relevant items, which can result in inaccurate\nrecommendations. Through further in-depth analysis, we find two factors that\nmay contribute to such inaccurate assignment of attention weights: sub-optimal\nposition encoding and noisy input. To this end, in this paper, we aim to\naddress this significant yet challenging gap in existing works. To be specific,\nwe propose a simple yet effective framework called Attention Calibration for\nTransformer-based Sequential Recommendation (AC-TSR). In AC-TSR, a novel\nspatial calibrator and adversarial calibrator are designed respectively to\ndirectly calibrates those incorrectly assigned attention weights. The former is\ndevised to explicitly capture the spatial relationships (i.e., order and\ndistance) among items for more precise calculation of attention weights. The\nlatter aims to redistribute the attention weights based on each item's\ncontribution to the next-item prediction. AC-TSR is readily adaptable and can\nbe seamlessly integrated into various existing transformer-based SR models.\nExtensive experimental results on four benchmark real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed ACTSR via significant\nrecommendation performance enhancements.

        "abstract": "Optimal adaptive bitrate (ABR) decision depends on a comprehensive\ncharacterization of state transitions that involve interrelated modalities over\ntime including environmental observations, returns, and actions. However,\nstate-of-the-art learning-based ABR algorithms solely rely on past observations\nto decide the next action. This paradigm tends to cause a chain of deviations\nfrom optimal action when encountering unfamiliar observations, which\nconsequently undermines the model generalization. This paper presents Karma, an\nABR algorithm that utilizes causal sequence modeling to improve generalization\nby comprehending the interrelated causality among past observations, returns,\nand actions and timely refining action when deviation occurs. Unlike direct\nobservation-to-action mapping, Karma recurrently maintains a multi-dimensional\ntime series of observations, returns, and actions as input and employs causal\nsequence modeling via a decision transformer to determine the next action. In\nthe input sequence, Karma uses the maximum cumulative future quality of\nexperience (QoE) (a.k.a, QoE-to-go) as an extended return signal, which is\nperiodically estimated based on current network conditions and playback status.\nWe evaluate Karma through trace-driven simulations and real-world field tests,\ndemonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art ABR\nalgorithms, with an average QoE improvement ranging from 10.8% to 18.7% across\ndiverse network conditions. Furthermore, Karma exhibits strong generalization\ncapabilities, showing leading performance under unseen networks in both\nsimulations and real-world tests.",

In this article, we present ORAN, an omnidirectional\naudio-visual navigator based on cross-task navigation skill transfer. In\nparticular, ORAN sharpens its two basic abilities for a such challenging task,\nnamely wayfinding and audio-visual information gathering. First, ORAN is\ntrained with a confidence-aware cross-task policy distillation (CCPD) strategy.\nCCPD transfers the fundamental, point-to-point wayfinding skill that is well\ntrained on the large-scale PointGoal task to ORAN, so as to help ORAN to better\nmaster audio-visual navigation with far fewer training samples. To improve the\nefficiency of knowledge transfer and address the domain gap, CCPD is made to be\nadaptive to the decision confidence of the teacher policy. Second, ORAN is\nequipped with an omnidirectional information gathering (OIG) mechanism, i.e.,\ngleaning visual-acoustic observations from different directions before\ndecision-making. As a result, ORAN yields more robust navigation behaviour.\nTaking CCPD and OIG together, ORAN significantly outperforms previous\ncompetitors. After the model ensemble, we got 1st in Soundspaces Challenge\n2022, improving SPL and SR by 53% and 35% relatively.",

        "abstract": "Traditional blockchains cannot achieve the same transaction throughput as\nWeb2, so their use cases are limited. Therefore, state sharding has been\nproposed to improve transaction throughput by dividing the blockchain network\nand managing states and transactions in parallel. However, Nightshade in the\nNEAR Protocol, a type of state sharding, provides a rollback protocol to cancel\nthe generation of blocks containing inconsistent transaction results because\nprocessing cross-shard transactions (CSTXs) in a 2-phase commit may cause state\ninconsistency. We present a new attack that interferes with the generation of\nnew blocks by repeatedly executing CSTXs that certainly causes state\ninconsistency, causing continuous rollback. We also propose a block-generation\nprotocol called Synchro to incorporate all the state changes of each CSTX into\nthe same block by coordinating the block prior to approving transactions in\neach shard. Synchro eliminates the occurrence of the state inconsistency caused\nby the CSTXs and the necessity of the rollback protocol. We use zero-knowledge\nproof to make Synchro scalable in the global validation phase. Although the\nactual overhead of the zero-knowledge proof has not yet been evaluated, we show\nthat Synchro could achieve the same transaction throughput as Nightshade\ntheoretically, depending on the future innovations in zero-knowledge proof\ntechniques.",

In\nparticular, cooking using a stove to apply heat to the foodstuff causes many\nspecial state changes that are not seen in other tasks, making it difficult to\ndesign a recognizer. In this study, we propose a unified method for recognizing\nchanges in the cooking state of robots by using the vision-language model that\ncan discriminate open-vocabulary objects in a time-series manner.

        "abstract": "Logical rules are essential for uncovering the logical connections between\nrelations, which could improve reasoning performance and provide interpretable\nresults on knowledge graphs (KGs). Although there have been many efforts to\nmine meaningful logical rules over KGs, existing methods suffer from\ncomputationally intensive searches over the rule space and a lack of\nscalability for large-scale KGs. Besides, they often ignore the semantics of\nrelations which is crucial for uncovering logical connections. Recently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in the field of\nnatural language processing and various applications, owing to their emergent\nability and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,\nChatRule, unleashing the power of large language models for mining logical\nrules over knowledge graphs. Specifically, the framework is initiated with an\nLLM-based rule generator, leveraging both the semantic and structural\ninformation of KGs to prompt LLMs to generate logical rules. To refine the\ngenerated rules, a rule ranking module estimates the rule quality by\nincorporating facts from existing KGs. Last, the ranked rules can be used to\nconduct reasoning over KGs. ChatRule is evaluated on four large-scale KGs,\nw.r.t. different rule quality metrics and downstream tasks, showing the\neffectiveness and scalability of our method.",

        "abstract": "Computation of heats of reaction of large molecules is now feasible using\ndomain-based PNO-CCSD(T) theory. However, to obtain agreement within 1~kcal\/mol\nof experiment, it is necessary to eliminate basis set incompleteness error,\nwhich comprises of both the AO basis set error and the PNO truncation error.\nOur investigation into the convergence to the canonical limit of PNO-CCSD(T)\nenergies with PNO truncation threshold $T$ shows that errors follow the model\n$E(T) = E + A T^{1\/2}$. Therefore, PNO truncation errors can be eliminated\nusing a simple two-point CPS extrapolation to the canonical limit, so that\nsubsequent CBS extrapolation is not limited by residual PNO truncation error.\nUsing the ISOL24 and MOBH35 data sets, we find that PNO truncation errors are\nlarger for molecules with significant static correlation, and that it is\nnecessary to use very tight thresholds of $T=10^{-8}$ to ensure errors do not\nexceed 1~kcal\/mol. We present a lower-cost extrapolation scheme that uses\ninformation from small basis sets to estimate PNO truncation errors for larger\nbasis sets. In this way the canonical limit of CCSD(T) calculations on large\nmolecules with large basis sets can be reliably estimated in a practical way.\nUsing this approach, we report complete basis set limit CCSD(T) reaction\nenergies for the full ISOL24 and MOBH35 data sets.",

        "abstract": "Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs) are commonly found in the real world, such as\nsocial networks and citation networks, and consist of nodes represented by\ntextual descriptions. Currently, mainstream machine learning methods on TAGs\ninvolve a two-stage modeling approach: (1) unsupervised node feature extraction\nwith pre-trained language models (PLMs); and (2) supervised learning using\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, we observe that these representations,\nwhich have undergone large-scale pre-training, do not significantly improve\nperformance with a limited amount of training samples. The main issue is that\nexisting methods have not effectively integrated information from the graph and\ndownstream tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\ncalled G-Prompt, which combines a graph adapter and task-specific prompts to\nextract node features. First, G-Prompt introduces a learnable GNN layer\n(\\emph{i.e.,} adaptor) at the end of PLMs, which is fine-tuned to better\ncapture the masked tokens considering graph neighborhood information. After the\nadapter is trained, G-Prompt incorporates task-specific prompts to obtain\n\\emph{interpretable} node representations for the downstream task. Our\nexperiment results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on few-shot node classification. More\nimportantly, in zero-shot settings, the G-Prompt embeddings can not only\nprovide better task interpretability than vanilla PLMs but also achieve\ncomparable performance with fully-supervised baselines.",

Based on our result, we propose a\nspatial-mode-resolving photon detector to increase communication bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease is a global health challenge that requires early and\naccurate detection to improve patient outcomes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI) holds significant diagnostic potential, but its effective analysis\nremains a formidable task. This study introduces a groundbreaking decentralized\nexpert system that cleverly combines blockchain technology with Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) to integrate robust anomaly detection for patient-submitted\ndata.\n  Traditional diagnostic methods often lead to delayed and imprecise\npredictions, especially in the early stages of the disease. Centralized data\nrepositories struggle to manage the immense volumes of MRI data, and persistent\nprivacy concerns hinder collaborative efforts. Our innovative solution\nharnesses decentralization to protect data integrity and patient privacy,\nfacilitated by blockchain technology. It not only emphasizes AI-driven MRI\nanalysis but also incorporates a sophisticated data anomaly detection\narchitecture. These mechanisms scrutinize patient-contributed data for various\nissues, including data quality problems and atypical findings within MRI\nimages.\n  Conducting an exhaustive check of MRI image correctness and quality directly\non the blockchain is impractical due to computational complexity and cost\nconstraints. Typically, such checks are performed off-chain, and the blockchain\nsecurely records the results. This comprehensive approach empowers our\ndecentralized app to provide more precise early-stage Alzheimer's Disease\npredictions. By merging the strengths of blockchain, AI, and anomaly detection,\nour system represents a pioneering step towards revolutionizing disease\ndiagnostics.",

We collect realistic data by performing any user\nrequests within the entirety of 3 office buildings and using multiple robot and\nhuman embodiments. With this data, we show that models trained on all\nembodiments perform better than ones trained on the robot data only, even when\nevaluated solely on robot episodes. We find that for a fixed collection budget\nit is beneficial to take advantage of cheaper human collection along with robot\ncollection. We release a large and highly diverse (29,520 unique instructions)\ndataset dubbed RoboVQA containing 829,502 (video, text) pairs for\nrobotics-focused visual question answering. We also demonstrate how evaluating\nreal robot experiments with an intervention mechanism enables performing tasks\nto completion, making it deployable with human oversight even if imperfect\nwhile also providing a single performance metric. We demonstrate a single\nvideo-conditioned model named RoboVQA-VideoCoCa trained on our dataset that is\ncapable of performing a variety of grounded high-level reasoning tasks in broad\nrealistic settings with a cognitive intervention rate 46% lower than the\nzero-shot state of the art visual language model (VLM) baseline and is able to\nguide real robots through long-horizon tasks. The performance gap with\nzero-shot state-of-the-art models indicates that a lot of grounded data remains\nto be collected for real-world deployment, emphasizing the critical need for\nscalable data collection approaches. Finally, we show that video VLMs\nsignificantly outperform single-image VLMs with an average error rate reduction\nof 19% across all VQA tasks.

In the current\npaper we aim to underscore a discrepancy between conventional training methods\nand the desired conditional sampling behavior of these models.

        "abstract": "Learning representations from videos requires understanding continuous motion\nand visual correspondences between frames. In this paper, we introduce the\nConcatenated Masked Autoencoders (CatMAE) as a spatial-temporal learner for\nself-supervised video representation learning. For the input sequence of video\nframes, CatMAE keeps the initial frame unchanged while applying substantial\nmasking (95%) to subsequent frames. The encoder in CatMAE is responsible for\nencoding visible patches for each frame individually; subsequently, for each\nmasked frame, the decoder leverages visible patches from both previous and\ncurrent frames to reconstruct the original image. Our proposed method enables\nthe model to estimate the motion information between visible patches, match the\ncorrespondences between preceding and succeeding frames, and ultimately learn\nthe evolution of scenes. Furthermore, we propose a new data augmentation\nstrategy, Video-Reverse (ViRe), which uses reversed video frames as the model's\nreconstruction targets. This further encourages the model to utilize continuous\nmotion details and correspondences to complete the reconstruction, thereby\nenhancing the model's capabilities. Compared to the most advanced pre-training\nmethods, CatMAE achieves a leading level in video segmentation tasks and action\nrecognition tasks.",

        "abstract": "The utilisation of deep learning segmentation algorithms that learn complex\norgans and tissue patterns and extract essential regions of interest from the\nnoisy background to improve the visual ability for medical image diagnosis has\nachieved impressive results in Medical Image Computing (MIC). This thesis\nfocuses on retinal blood vessel segmentation tasks, providing an extensive\nliterature review of deep learning-based medical image segmentation approaches\nwhile comparing the methodologies and empirical performances. The work also\nexamines the limitations of current state-of-the-art methods by pointing out\nthe two significant existing limitations: data size constraints and the\ndependency on high computational resources. To address such problems, this work\nproposes a novel efficient, simple multiview learning framework that\ncontrastively learns invariant vessel feature representation by comparing with\nmultiple augmented views by various transformations to overcome data shortage\nand improve generalisation ability. Moreover, the hybrid network architecture\nintegrates the attention mechanism into a Convolutional Neural Network to\nfurther capture complex continuous curvilinear vessel structures. The result\ndemonstrates the proposed method validated on the CHASE-DB1 dataset, attaining\nthe highest F1 score of 83.46% and the highest Intersection over Union (IOU)\nscore of 71.62% with UNet structure, surpassing existing benchmark UNet-based\nmethods by 1.95% and 2.8%, respectively. The combination of the metrics\nindicates the model detects the vessel object accurately with a highly\ncoincidental location with the ground truth. Moreover, the proposed approach\ncould be trained within 30 minutes by consuming less than 3 GB GPU RAM, and\nsuch characteristics support the efficient implementation for real-world\napplications and deployments.",

        "abstract": "Modern recommender systems employ various sequential modules such as\nself-attention to learn dynamic user interests. However, these methods are less\neffective in capturing collaborative and transitional signals within user\ninteraction sequences. First, the self-attention architecture uses the\nembedding of a single item as the attention query, making it challenging to\ncapture collaborative signals. Second, these methods typically follow an\nauto-regressive framework, which is unable to learn global item transition\npatterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new method called\nMulti-Query Self-Attention with Transition-Aware Embedding Distillation\n(MQSA-TED). First, we propose an $L$-query self-attention module that employs\nflexible window sizes for attention queries to capture collaborative signals.\nIn addition, we introduce a multi-query self-attention method that balances the\nbias-variance trade-off in modeling user preferences by combining long and\nshort-query self-attentions. Second, we develop a transition-aware embedding\ndistillation module that distills global item-to-item transition patterns into\nitem embeddings, which enables the model to memorize and leverage transitional\nsignals and serves as a calibrator for collaborative signals. Experimental\nresults on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed modules.",

        "title": "AiluRus: A Scalable ViT Framework for Dense Prediction",
        "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a prevalent architecture for\nvision tasks owing to their impressive performance. However, when it comes to\nhandling long token sequences, especially in dense prediction tasks that\nrequire high-resolution input, the complexity of ViTs increases significantly.\nNotably, dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation or object\ndetection, emphasize more on the contours or shapes of objects, while the\ntexture inside objects is less informative. Motivated by this observation, we\npropose to apply adaptive resolution for different regions in the image\naccording to their importance. Specifically, at the intermediate layer of the\nViT, we utilize a spatial-aware density-based clustering algorithm to select\nrepresentative tokens from the token sequence. Once the representative tokens\nare determined, we proceed to merge other tokens into their closest\nrepresentative token. Consequently, semantic similar tokens are merged together\nto form low-resolution regions, while semantic irrelevant tokens are preserved\nindependently as high-resolution regions. This strategy effectively reduces the\nnumber of tokens, allowing subsequent layers to handle a reduced token sequence\nand achieve acceleration. We evaluate our proposed method on three different\ndatasets and observe promising performance. For example, the \"Segmenter ViT-L\"\nmodel can be accelerated by 48% FPS without fine-tuning, while maintaining the\nperformance. Additionally, our method can be applied to accelerate fine-tuning\nas well. Experimental results demonstrate that we can save 52% training time\nwhile accelerating 2.46 times FPS with only a 0.09% performance drop.

Besides intrinsic contribution, extrinsic\ncontributions from scattering also enter the zeroth order term, and their\nvalues can be comparable to or even larger than the intrinsic one.

Existing defense approaches either fail to fully\nsafeguard model confidentiality or result in significant latency issues. To\novercome these challenges, this paper presents MirrorNet, which leverages\nTrusted Execution Environment (TEE) to enable secure on-device DNN inference.\nIt generates a TEE-friendly implementation for any given DNN model to protect\nthe model confidentiality, while meeting the stringent computation and storage\nconstraints of TEE. The framework consists of two key components: the backbone\nmodel (BackboneNet), which is stored in the normal world but achieves lower\ninference accuracy, and the Companion Partial Monitor (CPM), a lightweight\nmirrored branch stored in the secure world, preserving model confidentiality.\nDuring inference, the CPM monitors the intermediate results from the\nBackboneNet and rectifies the classification output to achieve higher accuracy.\nTo enhance flexibility, MirrorNet incorporates two modules: the CPM Strategy\nGenerator, which generates various protection strategies, and the Performance\nEmulator, which estimates the performance of each strategy and selects the most\noptimal one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MirrorNet\nin providing security guarantees while maintaining low computation latency,\nmaking MirrorNet a practical and promising solution for secure on-device DNN\ninference.

        "abstract": "Neural implicit representations have emerged as a promising solution for\nproviding dense geometry in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).\nHowever, existing methods in this direction fall short in terms of global\nconsistency and low latency. This paper presents NGEL-SLAM to tackle the above\nchallenges. To ensure global consistency, our system leverages a traditional\nfeature-based tracking module that incorporates loop closure. Additionally, we\nmaintain a global consistent map by representing the scene using multiple\nneural implicit fields, enabling quick adjustment to the loop closure.\nMoreover, our system allows for fast convergence through the use of\noctree-based implicit representations. The combination of rapid response to\nloop closure and fast convergence makes our system a truly low-latency system\nthat achieves global consistency. Our system enables rendering high-fidelity\nRGB-D images, along with extracting dense and complete surfaces. Experiments on\nboth synthetic and real-world datasets suggest that our system achieves\nstate-of-the-art tracking and mapping accuracy while maintaining low latency.",

        "abstract": "Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm\ndesigned for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. It is promising\nfor quantum chemical calculations (QCC) because it can calculate the\nground-state energy of a target molecule. Although VQE has a potential to\nachieve a higher accuracy than classical approximation methods in QCC, it is\nchallenging to achieve it on current NISQ computers due to the significant\nimpact of noises. Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) is a well-known\ntechnique to divide a molecule into multiple fragments, which is available to\nmitigate the noise impact on VQE. However, our preliminary evaluation shows\nthat the naive combination of DMET and VQE does not outperform a gold standard\nclassical method.\n  In this work, we present three approaches to mitigate the noise impact for\nthe DMET+VQE combination. (1) The size of quantum circuits used by VQE is\ndecreased by reducing the number of bath orbitals which represent interactions\nbetween multiple fragments in DMET. (2) Reduced density matrices (RDMs), which\nare used to calculate a molecular energy in DMET, are calculated accurately\nbased on expectation values obtained by executing quantum circuits using a\nnoise-less quantum computer simulator. (3) The parameters of a quantum circuit\noptimized by VQE are refined with mathematical post-processing. The evaluation\nusing a noisy quantum computer simulator shows that our approaches\nsignificantly improve the accuracy of the DMET+VQE combination. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that on a real NISQ device, the DMET+VQE combination applying our\nthree approaches achieves a higher accuracy than the gold standard classical\nmethod.",

However, prompting the LLMs to directly generate sub-questions\nis suboptimal since they sometimes generate redundant or irrelevant questions.\nTo deal with them, we propose a GE-Reasoning method, which directs LLMs to\ngenerate proper sub-questions and corresponding answers. Concretely, given an\ninput question, we first prompt the LLM to generate knowledge triplets, forming\na graph representation of the question. Unlike conventional knowledge triplets,\nour approach allows variables as head or tail entities, effectively\nrepresenting a question as knowledge triplets. Second, for each triplet, the\nLLM generates a corresponding sub-question and answer along with using\nknowledge retrieval. If the prediction confidence exceeds a threshold, the\nsub-question and prediction are incorporated into the prompt for subsequent\nprocessing. This approach encourages that sub-questions are grounded in the\nextracted knowledge triplets, reducing redundancy and irrelevance. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous CoT prompting\nmethods and their variants on multi-hop question answering benchmark datasets.",

The present work describes a systematic study of\nnine basic MAP architectures subdivided into two main groups, namely parallel\nand sequential distribution of resources from a single respective source.\nSeveral types of interconnections among the involved processing agents are also\nconsidered. The resulting MAP architectures are studied in terms of the total\namount of work, the dispersion of the resources (states) among the agents, and\nthe transition times from the start of operation until the respective steady\nstate. Several interesting results are obtained and discussed, including the\nobservation that some of the parallel designs were able to yield maximum work\nand minimum state dispersion, achieved at the expense of the transition time\nand use of several interconnections between the source and the agents. The\nresults obtained for the sequential designs indicate that relatively high\nperformance can be obtained for some specific cases.",

        "abstract": "Cyberattacks have grown into a major risk for organizations, with common\nconsequences being data theft, sabotage, and extortion. Since preventive\nmeasures do not suffice to repel attacks, timely detection of successful\nintruders is crucial to stop them from reaching their final goals. For this\npurpose, many organizations utilize Security Information and Event Management\n(SIEM) systems to centrally collect security-related events and scan them for\nattack indicators using expert-written detection rules. However, as we show by\nanalyzing a set of widespread SIEM detection rules, adversaries can evade\nalmost half of them easily, allowing them to perform common malicious actions\nwithin an enterprise network without being detected. To remedy these critical\ndetection blind spots, we propose the idea of adaptive misuse detection, which\nutilizes machine learning to compare incoming events to SIEM rules on the one\nhand and known-benign events on the other hand to discover successful evasions.\nBased on this idea, we present AMIDES, an open-source proof-of-concept adaptive\nmisuse detection system. Using four weeks of SIEM events from a large\nenterprise network and more than 500 hand-crafted evasions, we show that AMIDES\nsuccessfully detects a majority of these evasions without any false alerts. In\naddition, AMIDES eases alert analysis by assessing which rules were evaded. Its\ncomputational efficiency qualifies AMIDES for real-world operation and hence\nenables organizations to significantly reduce detection blind spots with\nmoderate effort.",

        "abstract": "Sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV) is central to numerous\ndata-intensive applications, but requires streaming indirect memory accesses\nthat severely degrade both processing and memory throughput in state-of-the-art\narchitectures. Near-memory hardware units, decoupling indirect streams from\nprocessing elements, partially alleviate the bottleneck, but rely on low DRAM\naccess granularity, which is highly inefficient for modern DRAM standards like\nHBM and LPDDR. To fully address the end-to-end challenge, we propose a\nlow-overhead data coalescer combined with a near-memory indirect streaming unit\nfor AXI-Pack, an extension to the widespread AXI4 protocol packing narrow\nirregular stream elements onto wide memory buses. Our combined solution\nleverages the memory-level parallelism and coalescence of streaming indirect\naccesses in irregular applications like SpMV to maximize the performance and\nbandwidth efficiency attained on wide memory interfaces. Our solution delivers\nan average speedup of 8x in effective indirect access, often reaching the full\nmemory bandwidth. As a result, we achieve an average end-to-end speedup on SpMV\nof 3x. Moreover, our approach demonstrates remarkable on-chip efficiency,\nrequiring merely 27kB of on-chip storage and a very compact implementation area\nof 0.2-0.3mm^2 in a 12nm node.",

        "abstract": "A realistic human kinematic model that satisfies anatomical constraints is\nessential for human-robot interaction, biomechanics and robot-assisted\nrehabilitation. Modeling realistic joint constraints, however, is challenging\nas human arm motion is constrained by joint limits, inter- and intra-joint\ndependencies, self-collisions, individual capabilities and muscular or\nneurological constraints which are difficult to represent. Hence, physicians\nand researchers have relied on simple box-constraints, ignoring important\nanatomical factors. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to learn\nrealistic anatomically constrained upper-limb range of motion (RoM) boundaries\nfrom motion capture data. This is achieved by fitting a one-class support\nvector machine to a dataset of upper-limb joint space exploration motions with\nan efficient hyper-parameter tuning scheme. Our approach outperforms similar\nworks focused on valid RoM learning. Further, we propose an impairment index\n(II) metric that offers a quantitative assessment of capability\/impairment when\ncomparing healthy and impaired arms. We validate the metric on healthy subjects\nphysically constrained to emulate hemiplegia and different disability levels as\nstroke patients.",

        "abstract": "The art of light engineering unveils a world of possibilities through the\nmeticulous manipulation of photonic properties such as intensity, phase, and\npolarization. The precise control over these optical properties under various\nconditions finds application in fields spanning communication, light-matter\ninteractions, laser direct writing, and imaging, enriching our technological\nlandscape. In this study, we embark on a journey to establish a rational\nframework for the design and assembly of nonparaxial THz imaging systems. Our\nfocus centers on a lensless photonic system composed solely of flat-silicon\ndiffractive optics. These elements include the high-resistivity silicon-based\nnonparaxial Fresnel zone plate, the Fibonacci lens, the Bessel axicon, and the\nAiry zone plate, all meticulously crafted using laser ablation technology. A\nsystematic exploration of these flat elements in various combinations sheds\nlight on their strengths and weaknesses. Our endeavor extends to the practical\napplication of these optical components, where they illuminate samples and\ncapture the light scattered from these raster-scanned samples using\nsingle-pixel detectors. Through a comprehensive examination, we evaluate\nimaging systems across diverse metrics that include contrast, resolution, depth\nof field and focus. This multifaceted approach allows us to distill rational\ndesign principles for the optimal assembly of THz imaging setups. The findings\nof this research chart an exciting course toward the development of compact,\nuser-friendly THz imaging systems where sensors and passive optical elements\nseamlessly integrate into a single chip. These innovations not only enhance\ncapabilities in THz imaging but also pave the way for novel applications,\nushering in a new encouraging era of advanced THz photonic technology.",

Furthermore,\nthere exist limitations concerning benchmark datasets and the metrics used to\nmeasure model performance in multilingual settings. This paper proposes\ncost-effective solutions to both aforementioned challenges. Firstly, we\nintroduce the Multilingual Instruction-Tuning Dataset (MITS), comprised of\nAlpaca-52K, Dolly-15K, and Vicuna Benchmark translations into 132 languages.\nSecondly, we propose a new method called \\emph{TaCo: Translation-Assisted\nCross-Linguality}, which utilizes translations in a chain-of-thought process to\ninstruction-tune LLMs on new languages through a curriculum-learning process.\nAs a proof of concept, we experimented with the instruction-tuned Guanaco-33B\nmodel, performing further instruction tuning using our proposed TaCo method in\nthree low-resource languages and one high-resource language. Our results\nindicate that the TaCo method impresses GPT-4 with an 82\\% score for a\nlow-resource language in the Vicuna Benchmark dataset, doubling the performance\nin contrast to instruction tuning alone. Furthermore, TaCo shows promise in\ncreating multilingual LLMs, even for low-resource languages.

        "abstract": "With the increasing use of deep learning on data collected by non-perfect\nsensors and in non-perfect environments, the robustness of deep learning\nsystems has become an important issue. A common approach for obtaining\nrobustness to noise has been to train deep learning systems with data augmented\nwith Gaussian noise. In this work, we challenge the common choice of Gaussian\nnoise and explore the possibility of stronger robustness for non-Gaussian\nimpulsive noise, specifically alpha-stable noise. Justified by the Generalized\nCentral Limit Theorem and evidenced by observations in various application\nareas, alpha-stable noise is widely present in nature. By comparing the testing\naccuracy of models trained with Gaussian noise and alpha-stable noise on data\ncorrupted by different noise, we find that training with alpha-stable noise is\nmore effective than Gaussian noise, especially when the dataset is corrupted by\nimpulsive noise, thus improving the robustness of the model. The generality of\nthis conclusion is validated through experiments conducted on various deep\nlearning models with image and time series datasets, and other benchmark\ncorrupted datasets. Consequently, we propose a novel data augmentation method\nthat replaces Gaussian noise, which is typically added to the training data,\nwith alpha-stable noise.",

We\nshow that students who received style feedback in real-time were five times\nmore likely to view and engage with their feedback compared to students who\nreceived delayed feedback. Moreover, those who viewed feedback were more likely\nto make significant style-related edits to their code, with over 79% of these\nedits directly incorporating their feedback. We also discuss the practicality\nand dangers of LLM-based tools for feedback, investigating the quality of the\nfeedback generated, LLM limitations, and techniques for consistency,\nstandardization, and safeguarding against demographic bias, all of which are\ncrucial for a tool utilized by students.",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) endeavors to adjust models trained on a\nsource domain to perform well on a target domain without requiring additional\nannotations. In the context of domain adaptive semantic segmentation, which\ntackles UDA for dense prediction, the goal is to circumvent the need for costly\npixel-level annotations. Typically, various prevailing methods baseline rely on\nconstructing intermediate domains via cross-domain mixed sampling techniques to\nmitigate the performance decline caused by domain gaps. However, such\napproaches generate synthetic data that diverge from real-world distributions,\npotentially leading the model astray from the true target distribution. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a novel auxiliary task called Guidance\nTraining. This task facilitates the effective utilization of cross-domain mixed\nsampling techniques while mitigating distribution shifts from the real world.\nSpecifically, Guidance Training guides the model to extract and reconstruct the\ntarget-domain feature distribution from mixed data, followed by decoding the\nreconstructed target-domain features to make pseudo-label predictions.\nImportantly, integrating Guidance Training incurs minimal training overhead and\nimposes no additional inference burden. We demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach by integrating it with existing methods, consistently improving\nperformance.

Because of this, HDR videos must be processed by\ntone-mapping them to reduced bit-depths to service a broad swath of SDR-limited\nvideo consumers. Here, we analyze the impact of tone-mapping operators on the\nvisual quality of streaming HDR videos. To this end, we built the first\nlarge-scale subjectively annotated open-source database of compressed\ntone-mapped HDR videos, containing 15,000 tone-mapped sequences derived from 40\nunique HDR source contents. The videos in the database were labeled with more\nthan 750,000 subjective quality annotations, collected from more than 1,600\nunique human observers. We demonstrate the usefulness of the new subjective\ndatabase by benchmarking objective models of visual quality on it.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning is the premier technique to approach sequential\ndecision problems, including complex tasks such as driving cars and landing\nspacecraft. Among the software validation and verification practices, testing\nfor functional fault detection is a convenient way to build trustworthiness in\nthe learned decision model. While recent works seek to maximise the number of\ndetected faults, none consider fault characterisation during the search for\nmore diversity. We argue that policy testing should not find as many failures\nas possible (e.g., inputs that trigger similar car crashes) but rather aim at\nrevealing as informative and diverse faults as possible in the model. In this\npaper, we explore the use of quality diversity optimisation to solve the\nproblem of fault diversity in policy testing. Quality diversity (QD)\noptimisation is a type of evolutionary algorithm to solve hard combinatorial\noptimisation problems where high-quality diverse solutions are sought. We\ndefine and address the underlying challenges of adapting QD optimisation to the\ntest of action policies. Furthermore, we compare classical QD optimisers to\nstate-of-the-art frameworks dedicated to policy testing, both in terms of\nsearch efficiency and fault diversity. We show that QD optimisation, while\nbeing conceptually simple and generally applicable, finds effectively more\ndiverse faults in the decision model, and conclude that QD-based policy testing\nis a promising approach.",

While much research focuses on utilizing\nML and DL to tackle security challenges, there is often a tendency to overlook\nthe practicality and feasibility of implementing these methods in real-time\nsettings. This oversight stems from the constrained processing power and memory\nof certain devices (IoT devices), as well as concerns about the\ngeneralizability of these approaches. Focusing on the detection of\nDNS-tunneling attacks in a router as a case study, we present an end-to-end\nprocess designed to effectively address these challenges.

However, such\ninvestigation has not been conducted for detecting multiple mental disorders.\nThe rationale behind the existence of a task-agnostic representation lies in\nthe overlapping symptoms among multiple mental disorders. Consequently, the\nbehavioural data collected for mental health assessment may carry a mixed bag\nof attributes related to multiple disorders. Motivated by that, in this study,\nwe explore a task-agnostic representation derived through SSL in the context of\ndetecting major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD) using audio and video data collected during interactive sessions. This\nstudy employs SSL models trained by predicting multiple fixed targets or masked\nframes. We propose a list of fixed targets to make the generated representation\nmore efficient for detecting MDD and PTSD. Furthermore, we modify the\nhyper-parameters of the SSL encoder predicting fixed targets to generate global\nrepresentations that capture varying temporal contexts. Both these innovations\nare noted to yield improved detection performances for considered mental\ndisorders and exhibit task-agnostic traits. In the context of the SSL model\npredicting masked frames, the generated global representations are also noted\nto exhibit task-agnostic traits.",

Current researches often sample cascade information into\nseveral independent paths or subgraphs to learn a simple cascade\nrepresentation. However, these approaches fail to exploit the hierarchical\nsemantic associations between different modalities, limiting their predictive\nperformance. In this work, we propose a novel Hierarchical Information\nEnhancement Network (HIENet) for cascade prediction. Our approach integrates\nfundamental cascade sequence, user social graphs, and sub-cascade graph into a\nunified framework. Specifically, HIENet utilizes DeepWalk to sample cascades\ninformation into a series of sequences. It then gathers path information\nbetween users to extract the social relationships of propagators. Additionally,\nwe employ a time-stamped graph convolutional network to aggregate sub-cascade\ngraph information effectively. Ultimately, we introduce a Multi-modal Cascade\nTransformer to powerfully fuse these clues, providing a comprehensive\nunderstanding of cascading process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The development of new materials typically involves a process of trial and\nerror, guided by insights from past experimental and theoretical findings. The\ninverse design approach for soft-matter systems has the potential to optimize\nspecific physical parameters such as particle interactions, particle shape, or\ncomposition and packing fraction. This optimization aims to facilitate the\nspontaneous formation of specific target structures through self-assembly. In\nthis study, we expand upon a recently introduced inverse design protocol for\nmonodisperse systems to identify the required conditions and interactions for\nassembling crystal and quasicrystal phases within a binary mixture of two\ndistinct species. This method utilizes an evolutionary algorithm to identify\nthe optimal state point and interaction parameters, enabling the self-assembly\nof the desired structure. Additionally, we employ a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) that classifies different phases based on their diffraction\npatterns, serving as a fitness function for the desired structure. Using our\nprotocol, we successfully inverse design two-dimensional crystalline\nstructures, including a hexagonal lattice, and a dodecagonal quasicrystal,\nwithin a non-additive binary mixture of hard disks. Finally, we introduce a\nsymmetry-based order parameter that leverages the encoded symmetry within the\ndiffraction pattern. This order parameter circumvents the need for training a\nCNN, and is used as a fitness function to inverse design an octagonal\nquasicrystal.",

        "abstract": "Despite today's prevalence of ultrasound imaging in medicine, ultrasound\nsignal-to-noise ratio is still affected by several sources of noise and\nartefacts. Moreover, enhancing ultrasound image quality involves balancing\nconcurrent factors like contrast, resolution, and speckle preservation.\nRecently, there has been progress in both model-based and learning-based\napproaches addressing the problem of ultrasound image reconstruction. Bringing\nthe best from both worlds, we propose a hybrid reconstruction method combining\nan ultrasound linear direct model with a learning-based prior coming from a\ngenerative Denoising Diffusion model. More specifically, we rely on the\nunsupervised fine-tuning of a pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Restoration Model\n(DDRM). Given the nature of multiplicative noise inherent to ultrasound, this\npaper proposes an empirical model to characterize the stochasticity of\ndiffusion reconstruction of ultrasound images, and shows the interest of its\nvariance as an echogenicity map estimator. We conduct experiments on synthetic,\nin-vitro, and in-vivo data, demonstrating the efficacy of our variance imaging\napproach in achieving high-quality image reconstructions from single plane-wave\nacquisitions and in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

        "abstract": "Watching movies and TV shows with subtitles enabled is not simply down to\naudibility or speech intelligibility. A variety of evolving factors related to\ntechnological advances, cinema production and social behaviour challenge our\nperception and understanding. This study seeks to formalise and give context to\nthese influential factors under a wider and novel term referred to as Dialogue\nUnderstandability. We propose a working definition for Dialogue\nUnderstandability being a listener's capacity to follow the story without undue\ncognitive effort or concentration being required that impacts their Quality of\nExperience (QoE). The paper identifies, describes and categorises the factors\nthat influence Dialogue Understandability mapping them over the QoE framework,\na media streaming lifecycle, and the stakeholders involved. We then explore\navailable measurement tools in the literature and link them to the factors they\ncould potentially be used for. The maturity and suitability of these tools is\nevaluated over a set of pilot experiments. Finally, we reflect on the gaps that\nstill need to be filled, what we can measure and what not, future subjective\nexperiments, and new research trends that could help us to fully characterise\nDialogue Understandability.",

Above 85~K temperature, we\nconfirm the antiferromagnetic behavior of magnetization $M$, which is known for\n$\\alpha$--MnTe. Below 85~K, we observe anomalous low-field magnetization\nbehavior, which is accompanied by the sophisticated $M(\\alpha)$ angle\ndependence with beating pattern as the interplay between $M(\\alpha)$ maxima and\nminima: in low fields, $M(\\alpha)$ shows ferromagnetic-like 180$^\\circ$\nperiodicity, while at high magnetic fields, the periodicity is changed to the\n90$^\\circ$ one. This angle dependence is the most striking result of our\nexperiment, while it can not be expected for standard magnetic systems. In\ncontrast, in altermagnets, symmetry allows ferromagnetic behavior only due to\nthe spin-orbit coupling. Thus, we claim that our experiment shows the effect of\nweak spin-orbit coupling in MnTe, with crossover from relativistic to\nnon-relativistic net magnetization, and, therefore, we experimentally confirm\naltermagnetism in MnTe.",

        "abstract": "Background. Osteoarthritis affects about 528 million people worldwide,\ncausing pain and stiffness in the joints. Arthroplasty is commonly performed to\ntreat joint osteoarthritis, reducing pain and improving mobility. Nevertheless,\na significant share of patients remain unsatisfied with their surgery.\nPersonalised arthroplasty was introduced to improve surgical outcomes however\ncurrent solutions require delays, making it difficult to integrate in clinical\nroutine. We propose a fully automated workflow to design patient-specific\nimplants for total knee arthroplasty.\n  Methods. The proposed pipeline first uses artificial neural networks to\nsegment the femur and tibia proximal and distal extremities. Then the full\nbones are reconstructed using augmented statistical shape models, combining\nshape and landmarks information. Finally, 77 morphological parameters are\ncomputed to design patient-specific implants. The developed workflow has been\ntrained on 91 CT scans and evaluated on 41 CT scans, in terms of accuracy and\nexecution time.\n  Results. The workflow accuracy was $0.4\\pm0.2mm$ for segmentation,\n$1.0\\pm0.3mm$ for full bone reconstruction, and $2.2\\pm1.5mm$ for anatomical\nlandmarks determination. The custom implants fitted the patients' anatomy with\n$0.9\\pm0.5mm$ accuracy. The whole process from segmentation to implants' design\nlasted about 15 minutes.\n  Conclusion. The proposed workflow performs a fast and reliable\npersonalisation of knee implants, directly from a CT image without requiring\nany manual intervention. It allows the establishment of a patient-specific\npre-operative planning in a very short time, making it easily available for all\npatients. Combined with efficient implant manufacturing techniques, this\nsolution could help answer the growing number of arthroplasties while reducing\ncomplications and improving patients' satisfaction.",

        "title": "LLaVA-PruMerge: Adaptive Token Reduction for Efficient Large Multimodal Models",
        "abstract": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant visual reasoning\ncapabilities by connecting a visual encoder and a large language model. LMMs\ntypically take in a fixed and large amount of visual tokens, such as the\npenultimate layer features in the CLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content.\nRecent LMMs incorporate more complex visual inputs, such as high-resolution\nimages and videos, which further increases the number of visual tokens\nsignificantly. However, due to the inherent design of the Transformer\narchitecture, the computational costs of these models tend to increase\nquadratically with the number of input tokens. To tackle this problem, we\nexplore a token reduction mechanism that identifies significant spatial\nredundancy among visual tokens. In response, we propose PruMerge, a novel\nadaptive visual token reduction strategy that significantly reduces the number\nof visual tokens without compromising the performance of LMMs. Specifically, to\nmetric the importance of each token, we exploit the sparsity observed in the\nvisual encoder, characterized by the sparse distribution of attention scores\nbetween the class token and visual tokens. This sparsity enables us to\ndynamically select the most crucial visual tokens to retain. Subsequently, we\ncluster the selected (unpruned) tokens based on their key similarity and merge\nthem with the unpruned tokens, effectively supplementing and enhancing their\ninformational content. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-1.5, our approach can\ncompress the visual tokens by 14 times on average, and achieve comparable\nperformance across diverse visual question-answering and reasoning tasks.

        "abstract": "The opioid epidemic, referring to the growing hospitalizations and deaths\nbecause of overdose of opioid usage and addiction, has become a severe health\nproblem in the United States. Many strategies have been developed by the\nfederal and local governments and health communities to combat this crisis.\nAmong them, improving our understanding of the epidemic through better health\nsurveillance is one of the top priorities. In addition to direct testing,\nmachine learning approaches may also allow us to detect opioid users by\nanalyzing data from social media because many opioid users may choose not to do\nthe tests but may share their experiences on social media anonymously. In this\npaper, we take advantage of recent advances in machine learning, collect and\nanalyze user posts from a popular social network Reddit with the goal to\nidentify opioid users. Posts from more than 1,000 users who have posted on\nthree sub-reddits over a period of one month have been collected. In addition\nto the ones that contain keywords such as opioid, opiate, or heroin, we have\nalso collected posts that contain slang words of opioid such as black or\nchocolate. We apply an attention-based bidirectional long short memory model to\nidentify opioid users. Experimental results show that the approaches\nsignificantly outperform competitive algorithms in terms of F1-score.\nFurthermore, the model allows us to extract most informative words, such as\nopiate, opioid, and black, from posts via the attention layer, which provides\nmore insights on how the machine learning algorithm works in distinguishing\ndrug users from non-drug users.",

We motivate the\nimportance and potential of IMU data and its applicability in cross-modality\nlearning as well as the importance of studying the HAR problem. We categorize\nHAR related tasks by time and abstractness and then compare various types of\nmultimodal HAR datasets. We also distinguish and expound on many related but\ninconsistently used terms in the literature, such as transfer learning, domain\nadaptation, representation learning, sensor fusion, and multimodal learning,\nand describe how cross-modal learning fits with all these concepts. We then\nreview the literature in IMU-based cross-modal transfer for HAR. The two main\napproaches for cross-modal transfer are instance-based transfer, where\ninstances of one modality are mapped to another (e.g. knowledge is transferred\nin the input space), or feature-based transfer, where the model relates the\nmodalities in an intermediate latent space (e.g. knowledge is transferred in\nthe feature space). Finally, we discuss future research directions and\napplications in cross-modal HAR.",

Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoRAG\nsurpasses existing state-of-the-art models in terms of BLEU score, ROUGE score,\nand perplexity, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving both coherence and\nrelevance in generated text. The qualitative assessment further illustrates\nLoRAG's capability to produce contextually rich and coherent outputs.

        "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU), one of the key enabling technologies for\nhuman-computer interaction in IoT devices, provides an easy-to-use user\ninterface. Human speech can contain a lot of user-sensitive information, such\nas gender, identity, and sensitive content. New types of security and privacy\nbreaches have thus emerged. Users do not want to expose their personal\nsensitive information to malicious attacks by untrusted third parties. Thus,\nthe SLU system needs to ensure that a potential malicious attacker cannot\ndeduce the sensitive attributes of the users, while it should avoid greatly\ncompromising the SLU accuracy. To address the above challenge, this paper\nproposes a novel SLU multi-task privacy-preserving model to prevent both the\nspeech recognition (ASR) and identity recognition (IR) attacks. The model uses\nthe hidden layer separation technique so that SLU information is distributed\nonly in a specific portion of the hidden layer, and the other two types of\ninformation are removed to obtain a privacy-secure hidden layer. In order to\nachieve good balance between efficiency and privacy, we introduce a new\nmechanism of model pre-training, namely joint adversarial training, to further\nenhance the user privacy. Experiments over two SLU datasets show that the\nproposed method can reduce the accuracy of both the ASR and IR attacks close to\nthat of a random guess, while leaving the SLU performance largely unaffected.",

Extensive experiments are\nconducted to compare the proposed method and eight state-of-the-art approaches\nusing a BUS dataset with 325 images.

The key to our approach is introducing a\nnegative feedback term into the robots' utility, which also eliminates the\ntrivial solution where foraging or not foraging are strictly dominant\nstrategies. We compare our approach qualitatively to existing an global games\napproach, where a positive positive feedback term admits threshold-based\ndecision making that encourages many robots to forage. We discuss how positive\nfeedback can lead to a cascading failure when robots are removed from the\nsystem, and we demonstrate the resilience of our approach in simulation.",

While free-space optical (FSO) links\nefficiently facilitate intersatellite data forwarding, they suffer from\natmospheric\/weather conditions in the space-to-ground link. This study delves\ninto utilizing high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) as elevated relay\nstations strategically positioned above terrestrial ground stations. We\nintroduce the concept of high-altitude ground stations (HAGS), an innovative\napproach to enabling the development of all optical LEO satellite\nconstellations. The first contribution is an analysis of the HAGS-based network\narchitecture where the LEO spacecraft only hosts FSO transceivers. Secondly, we\nexecute an extensive simulation campaign to determine the gain of HAGS,\nincluding a new equivalency model with the traditional ground station approach.\nFinally, we examine the research challenges of implementing HAGS-based, all\noptical LEO mega-constellations.",

For the skeletal sequences of swimming zebrafish, we propose a\npioneering Transformer-CNN architecture, the Sequence Spatial-Temporal\nTransformer (SSTFormer), designed to capture the inter-frame correlation of\ndifferent joints. This correlation is particularly valuable, as it reflects the\ncoordinated movement of various parts of the fish body across adjacent frames.\nTo handle the high frame rate, we segment the skeleton sequence into distinct\ntime slices, analogous to \"words\" in a sentence, and employ self-attention\ntransformer layers to encode the consecutive frames within each slice,\ncapturing the spatial correlation among different joints. Furthermore, we\nincorporate a CNN-based attention module to enhance the representations\noutputted by the transformer layers.

The\nconsidered CSI-RFF is built on micro-CSI, a recently discovered radio-frequency\n(RF) fingerprint that manifests as micro-signals appearing on the channel state\ninformation (CSI) curves of commercial WiFi devices. Micro-CSI facilitates\nCSI-RFF which is more streamlined and easily implementable compared to existing\nschemes that rely on raw I\/Q samples. The primary challenge resides in the\nprecise extraction of micro-CSI from the inherently fluctuating CSI\nmeasurements, a process critical for reliable RFF. The construction of a\nframework that is resilient to channel variability is essential for the\npractical deployment of CSI-RFF techniques. DeepCRF addresses this challenge\nwith a thoughtfully trained convolutional neural network (CNN). This network's\nperformance is significantly enhanced by employing effective and strategic data\naugmentation techniques, which bolster its ability to generalize to novel,\nunseen channel conditions. Furthermore, DeepCRF incorporates supervised\ncontrastive learning to enhance its robustness against noises.

This paper\nproposes a distillation framework for the AT method instead of crafting a\ncarefully designed adapter module, which aims to improve fine-tuning\nperformance. For the first time, we explore the possibility of combining the AT\nmethod with knowledge distillation. Via statistical analysis, we observe\nsignificant differences in the knowledge acquisition between adapter modules of\ndifferent models. Leveraging these differences, we propose a simple yet\neffective framework called inverse Distillation Adapter-Tuning (iDAT).\nSpecifically, we designate the smaller model as the teacher and the larger\nmodel as the student. The two are jointly trained, and online knowledge\ndistillation is applied to inject knowledge of different perspective to student\nmodel, and significantly enhance the fine-tuning performance on downstream\ntasks. Extensive experiments on the VTAB-1K benchmark with 19 image\nclassification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of iDAT. The results show\nthat using existing AT method within our iDAT framework can further yield a\n2.66% performance gain, with only an additional 0.07M trainable parameters.

        "title": "Optimal Control of Spin Qudits Subject to Decoherence Using Amplitude-and-Frequency-Constrained Pulses",
        "abstract": "Quantum optimal control theory (QOCT) can be used to design the shape of\nelectromagnetic pulses that implement operations on quantum devices. By using\nnon-trivially shaped waveforms, gates can be made significantly faster than\nthose built by concatenating monochromatic pulses. Recently, we applied this\ntechnique to the control of molecular spin qudits modelled with Schr\\\"odinger's\nequation and showed it can speed up operations, helping mitigate the effects of\ndecoherence [Phys. Rev. Appl. 17, 064028 (2022)]. However, short gate times\nresult in large optimal pulse amplitudes, which may not be experimentally\naccessible. Introducing bounds to the amplitudes then unavoidably leads to\nlonger operation times, for which decoherence can no longer be neglected. Here,\nwe study how to improve this procedure by applying QOCT on top of Lindblad's\nequation, to design control pulses accounting for decoherence already in the\noptimization process. In addition, we introduce a formulation that allows us to\nbound the maximum amplitude and frequency of the signals, which are the typical\nlimitations of waveform generators. The pulses we obtain consistently enhance\noperation fidelities compared to those achieved with Schr\\\"odinger's equation\nacross various target gates and durations, demonstrating the flexibility and\nrobustness of our method. The improvement is larger the shorter the spin\ncoherence time $T_{2}$.",

        "abstract": "Robotic exoskeletons can enhance human strength and aid people with physical\ndisabilities. However, designing them to ensure safety and optimal performance\npresents significant challenges. Developing exoskeletons should incorporate\nspecific optimization algorithms to find the best design. This study\ninvestigates the potential of Evolutionary Computation (EC) methods in robotic\ndesign optimization, with an underactuated hand exoskeleton (U-HEx) used as a\ncase study. We propose improving the performance and usability of the U-HEx\ndesign, which was initially optimized using a naive brute-force approach, by\nintegrating EC techniques such as Genetic Algorithm and Big Bang-Big Crunch\nAlgorithm. Comparative analysis revealed that EC methods consistently yield\nmore precise and optimal solutions than brute force in a significantly shorter\ntime. This allowed us to improve the optimization by increasing the number of\nvariables in the design, which was impossible with naive methods. The results\nshow significant improvements in terms of the torque magnitude the device\ntransfers to the user, enhancing its efficiency. These findings underline the\nimportance of performing proper optimization while designing exoskeletons, as\nwell as providing a significant improvement to this specific robotic design.",

        "abstract": "Owing to its immense storage density and durability, DNA has emerged as a\npromising storage medium. However, due to technological constraints, data can\nonly be written onto many short DNA molecules called data blocks that are\nstored in an unordered way. To handle the unordered nature of DNA data storage\nsystems, a unique address is typically prepended to each data block to form a\nDNA strand. However, DNA storage systems are prone to errors and generate\nmultiple noisy copies of each strand called DNA reads. Thus, we study the\npermutation recovery problem against deletions errors for DNA data storage.\n  The permutation recovery problem for DNA data storage requires one to\nreconstruct the addresses or in other words to uniquely identify the noisy\nreads. By successfully reconstructing the addresses, one can essentially\ndetermine the correct order of the data blocks, effectively solving the\nclustering problem.\n  We first show that we can almost surely identify all the noisy reads under\ncertain mild assumptions. We then propose a permutation recovery procedure and\nanalyze its complexity.",

        "abstract": "Exciton-polaritons represent a promising platform that combines the strengths\nof both photonic and electronic systems for future optoelectronic devices.\nHowever, their application is currently limited to laboratory research due to\nthe high cost and complexity of fabrication methods, which are not compatible\nwith the mature CMOS technology developed for microelectronics. In this work,\nwe develop an innovative, low-cost, and CMOS-compatible method for fabricating\nlarge surface polaritonic devices. This is achieved by direct patterning of a\nhalide-perovskite thin film via thermal nanoimprint. As a result, we observe\nhighly homogeneous polaritonic modes of quality factor $Q\\approx 300$ at room\ntemperature across a centimetric scale. Impressively, the process provides high\nreproducibility and fidelity, as the same mold can be reused more than 10 times\nto imprint the perovskite layer on different types of substrates. Our results\ncould pave the way for the production of low-cost integrated polaritonic\ndevices operating at room temperature.",

        "abstract": "In parking lots with large groups of electric vehicles (EVs), charging has to\nhappen in a coordinated manner, among others, due to the high load per vehicle\nand the limited capacity of the electricity grid. To achieve such coordination,\nmodel predictive control can be applied, thereby repeatedly solving an\noptimization problem. Due to its repetitive nature and its dependency on the\ntime granularity, optimization has to be (computationally) efficient. The work\npresented here focuses on that optimization subroutine, its computational\nefficiency and how to speed up the optimization for large groups of EVs. In\nparticular, we adapt FOCS, an algorithm that can solve the underlying\noptimization problem, to better suit the repetitive set-up of model predictive\ncontrol by adding a pre-mature stop feature. Based on real-world data, we\nempirically show that the added feature speeds up the median computation time\nfor 1-minute granularity by up to 44%. Furthermore, since FOCS is an algorithm\nthat uses maximum flow methods as a subroutine, the impact of choosing various\nmaximum flow methods on the runtime is investigated. Finally, we compare FOCS\nto a commercially available solver, concluding that FOCS outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art when making a full-day schedule for large groups of EVs.",

        "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of\nThings (CPS-IoT) applications and Foundation Models are enabling new\napplications that leverage real-time control of the environment. For example,\nreal-time control of Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems\ncan reduce its usage when not needed for the comfort of human occupants, hence\nreducing energy consumption. Collecting real-time feedback on human preferences\nin such human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems, however, is difficult in practice. We\npropose the use of large language models (LLMs) to deal with the challenges of\ndynamic environments and difficult-to-obtain data in CPS optimization. In this\npaper, we present a case study that employs LLM agents to mimic the behaviors\nand thermal preferences of various population groups (e.g. young families, the\nelderly) in a shopping mall. The aggregated thermal preferences are integrated\ninto an agent-in-the-loop based reinforcement learning algorithm AitL-RL, which\nemploys the LLM as a dynamic simulation of the physical environment to learn\nhow to balance between energy savings and occupant comfort. Our results show\nthat LLMs are capable of simulating complex population movements within large\nopen spaces. Besides, AitL-RL demonstrates superior performance compared to the\npopular existing policy of set point control, suggesting that adaptive and\npersonalized decision-making is critical for efficient optimization in CPS-IoT\napplications.

        "abstract": "Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to jointly infer semantics and\noccupancies of 3D scenes. Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF), a 3D\nencoding of depth, has been a common input for SSC.

Nevertheless, RGB-TSDF fusion has been considered\nnontrivial and commonly-used naive addition will result in inconsistent\nresults. We argue that the inconsistency comes from the sparsity of RGB\nfeatures upon projecting into 3D space, while TSDF features are dense, leading\nto imbalanced feature maps when summed up. To address this RGB-TSDF\ndistribution difference, we propose a two-stage network with a 3D RGB feature\ncompletion module that completes RGB features with meaningful values for\noccluded areas.

It enables Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the\nedge by creating models without sharing actual data across the network.\nExisting research typically focuses on generic aspects of non-IID data and\nheterogeneity in client's system characteristics, but they often neglect the\nissue of insufficient data for model development, which can arise from uneven\nclass label distribution and highly variable data volumes across edge nodes. In\nthis work, we propose FLIGAN, a novel approach to address the issue of data\nincompleteness in FL. First, we leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nto adeptly capture complex data distributions and generate synthetic data that\nclosely resemble real-world data. Then, we use synthetic data to enhance the\nrobustness and completeness of datasets across nodes. Our methodology adheres\nto FL's privacy requirements by generating synthetic data in a federated manner\nwithout sharing the actual data in the process. We incorporate techniques such\nas classwise sampling and node grouping, designed to improve the federated\nGAN's performance, enabling the creation of high-quality synthetic datasets and\nfacilitating efficient FL training.

As deep learning has become the state-of-the-art\nfor computer-assisted diagnosis, integrating human behavior, such as eye gaze\ndata, into these systems is instrumental to help align machine predictions with\nclinical diagnostic criteria, thus enhancing the quality of automatic\nradiological diagnosis. Methods: We propose a novel deep learning framework for\njoint disease diagnosis and prediction of corresponding clinical visual\nattention maps for chest X-ray scans.

        "abstract": "In recent years, a variety of ML architectures and techniques have seen\nsuccess in producing skillful medium range weather forecasts. In particular,\nVision Transformer (ViT)-based models (e.g. Pangu-Weather, FuXi) have shown\nstrong performance, working nearly \"out-of-the-box\" by treating weather data as\na multi-channel image on a rectilinear grid. While a rectilinear grid is\nappropriate for 2D images, weather data is inherently spherical and thus\nheavily distorted at the poles on a rectilinear grid, leading to\ndisproportionate compute being used to model data near the poles. Graph-based\nmethods (e.g. GraphCast) do not suffer from this problem, as they map the\nlongitude-latitude grid to a spherical mesh, but are generally more memory\nintensive and tend to need more compute resources for training and inference.\nWhile spatially homogeneous, the spherical mesh does not lend itself readily to\nbe modeled by ViT-based models that implicitly rely on the rectilinear grid\nstructure. We present HEAL-ViT, a novel architecture that uses ViT models on a\nspherical mesh, thus benefiting from both the spatial homogeneity enjoyed by\ngraph-based models and efficient attention-based mechanisms exploited by\ntransformers. HEAL-ViT produces weather forecasts that outperform the ECMWF IFS\non key metrics, and demonstrate better bias accumulation and blurring than\nother ML weather prediction models. Further, the lowered compute footprint of\nHEAL-ViT makes it attractive for operational use as well, where other models in\naddition to a 6-hourly prediction model may be needed to produce the full set\nof operational forecasts required.",

For the prompt, we adopt a re-transmission-based scheme to ensure\nreliable transmission, and for the other semantic modalities we use an adaptive\nmodulation\/coding scheme to achieve robustness to the changing wireless\nchannel. Furthermore, we design a semantic and latency-aware scheme to allocate\ntransmission power to different semantic modalities based on their importance\nsubjected to semantic quality constraints. At the receiver, a pre-trained\ngenerative model synthesizes a high fidelity signal using the received\nmulti-stream semantics.

First, there are\nnumerous possible combinations of mappings from seen to unseen domains because\nusers have usually interacted with a different subset of service domains.\nSecond, a user might have different preferences for each of the target unseen\ndomains, which requires that recommendations reflect the user's preferences on\ndomains as well as items. To tackle these challenges, we propose DRIP framework\nthat models users' preferences at two levels (i.e., domain and item) and learns\nvarious seen-unseen domain mappings in a unified way with masked domain\nmodeling. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRIP in\nMDRAU task and its ability to capture users' domain-level preferences.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising approach to\nbridge the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods and the efficiency of\nclassical force fields. However, the abundance of MLFF models and the challenge\nof accurately predicting atomic forces pose significant obstacles in their\npractical application. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning\nframework, EL-MLFFs, which leverages the stacking method to integrate\npredictions from diverse MLFFs and enhance force prediction accuracy. By\nconstructing a graph representation of molecular structures and employing a\ngraph neural network (GNN) as the meta-model, EL-MLFFs effectively captures\natomic interactions and refines force predictions. We evaluate our approach on\ntwo distinct datasets: methane molecules and methanol adsorbed on a Cu(100)\nsurface. The results demonstrate that EL-MLFFs significantly improves force\nprediction accuracy compared to individual MLFFs, with the ensemble of all\neight models yielding the best performance. Moreover, our ablation study\nhighlights the crucial roles of the residual network and graph attention layers\nin the model's architecture. The EL-MLFFs framework offers a promising solution\nto the challenges of model selection and force prediction accuracy in MLFFs,\npaving the way for more reliable and efficient molecular simulations.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising in-context learning\nabilities. However, conventional In-Context Learning (ICL) approaches are often\nimpeded by length limitations of transformer architecture, which pose\nchallenges when attempting to effectively integrate supervision from a\nsubstantial number of demonstration examples. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel framework, called Naive Bayes-based Context Extension (NBCE), to enable\nexisting LLMs to perform ICL with an increased number of demonstrations by\nsignificantly expanding their context size. Importantly, this expansion does\nnot require fine-tuning or dependence on particular model architectures, all\nthe while preserving linear efficiency. NBCE initially splits the context into\nequal-sized windows fitting the target LLM's maximum length. Then, it\nintroduces a voting mechanism to select the most relevant window, regarded as\nthe posterior context. Finally, it employs Bayes' theorem to generate the test\ntask. Our experimental results demonstrate that NBCE substantially enhances\nperformance, particularly as the number of demonstration examples increases,\nconsistently outperforming alternative methods. The NBCE code will be made\npublicly accessible. The code NBCE is available at:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/amurtadha\/NBCE-master",

Our dataset is\nconstructed from a subset of the Chronicling America newspaper collection\nspanning 120 years. One of the significant challenges for utilizing digitized\nhistorical newspaper collections is the low quality of OCR text. Therefore, to\nenable realistic testing of QA models, our dataset can be used in three\ndifferent ways: answering questions from raw and noisy content, answering\nquestions from cleaner, corrected version of the content, as well as answering\nquestions from scanned images of newspaper pages.

The attention directed towards hypercomplex models\noriginates from several aspects, spanning from purely theoretical and\nmathematical characteristics to the practical advantage of lightweight models\nover conventional networks, and their unique properties to capture both global\nand local relations. In particular, a branch of these architectures,\nparameterized hypercomplex neural networks (PHNNs), has also gained popularity\ndue to their versatility across a multitude of application domains.\nNonetheless, only few attempts have been made to explain or interpret their\nintricacies. In this paper, we propose inherently interpretable PHNNs and\nquaternion-like networks, thus without the need for any post-hoc method. To\nachieve this, we define a type of cosine-similarity transform within the\nparameterized hypercomplex domain. This PHB-cos transform induces weight\nalignment with relevant input features and allows to reduce the model into a\nsingle linear transform, rendering it directly interpretable. In this work, we\nstart to draw insights into how this unique branch of neural models operates.\nWe observe that hypercomplex networks exhibit a tendency to concentrate on the\nshape around the main object of interest, in addition to the shape of the\nobject itself. We provide a thorough analysis, studying single neurons of\ndifferent layers and comparing them against how real-valued networks learn.

        "abstract": "Control barrier functions (CBFs) have recently been introduced as a\nsystematic tool to ensure safety by establishing set invariance. When combined\nwith a control Lyapunov function (CLF), they form a safety-critical control\nmechanism. However, the effectiveness of CBFs and CLFs is closely tied to the\nsystem model. In practice, model uncertainty can jeopardize safety and\nstability guarantees and may lead to undesirable performance. In this paper, we\ndevelop a safe learning-based control strategy for switching systems in the\nface of uncertainty. We focus on the case that a nominal model is available for\na true underlying switching system. This uncertainty results in piecewise\nresiduals for each switching surface, impacting the CLF and CBF constraints. We\nintroduce a batch multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) framework to approximate\nthese piecewise residuals, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of\nuncertainty. A particular structure of the covariance function enables us to\nconvert the MOGP-based chance constraints CLF and CBF into second-order cone\nconstraints, which leads to a convex optimization. We analyze the feasibility\nof the resulting optimization and provide the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for feasibility. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is\nvalidated through a simulation of a switching adaptive cruise control system.",

        "title": "Self-Clustering Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Extensible Cooperation Graph",
        "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has been successful in solving many\ncooperative challenges. However, classic non-hierarchical MARL algorithms still\ncannot address various complex multi-agent problems that require hierarchical\ncooperative behaviors. The cooperative knowledge and policies learned in\nnon-hierarchical algorithms are implicit and not interpretable, thereby\nrestricting the integration of existing knowledge. This paper proposes a novel\nhierarchical MARL model called Hierarchical Cooperation Graph Learning (HCGL)\nfor solving general multi-agent problems. HCGL has three components: a dynamic\nExtensible Cooperation Graph (ECG) for achieving self-clustering cooperation; a\ngroup of graph operators for adjusting the topology of ECG; and an MARL\noptimizer for training these graph operators. HCGL's key distinction from other\nMARL models is that the behaviors of agents are guided by the topology of ECG\ninstead of policy neural networks. ECG is a three-layer graph consisting of an\nagent node layer, a cluster node layer, and a target node layer. To manipulate\nthe ECG topology in response to changing environmental conditions, four graph\noperators are trained to adjust the edge connections of ECG dynamically. The\nhierarchical feature of ECG provides a unique approach to merge primitive\nactions (actions executed by the agents) and cooperative actions (actions\nexecuted by the clusters) into a unified action space, allowing us to integrate\nfundamental cooperative knowledge into an extensible interface. In our\nexperiments, the HCGL model has shown outstanding performance in multi-agent\nbenchmarks with sparse rewards. We also verify that HCGL can easily be\ntransferred to large-scale scenarios with high zero-shot transfer success\nrates.",

        "abstract": "With exponential growth in distributed energy resources (DERs) coupled with\nat-capacity distribution grid infrastructure, prosumers cannot always export\nall extra power to the grid without violating technical limits. Consequently, a\nslew of dynamic hosting capacity (DHC) algorithms have emerged for optimal\nutilization of grid infrastructure while maximizing export from DERs. Most of\nthese DHC algorithms utilize the concept of operating envelopes (OE), where the\nutility gives prosumers technical power export limits, and they are free to\nexport power within these limits. Recent studies have shown that OE-based\nframeworks have drawbacks, as most develop power export limits based on convex\nor linear grid models. As OEs must capture extreme operating conditions, both\nconvex and linear models can violate technical limits in practice because they\napproximate grid physics. However, AC models are unsuitable because they may\nnot be feasible within the whole region of OE. We propose a new two-stage\noptimization framework for DHC built on three-phase AC models to address the\ncurrent gaps. In this approach, the prosumers first run a receding horizon\nmulti-period optimization to identify optimal export power setpoints to\ncommunicate with the utility. The utility then performs an infeasibility-based\noptimization to either accept the prosumer's request or dispatch an optimal\ncurtail signal such that overall system technical constraints are not violated.\nTo explore various curtailment strategies, we develop an L1, L2, and Linf\nnorm-based dispatch algorithm with an exact three-phase AC model. We test our\nframework on a 1420 three-phase node meshed distribution network and show that\nthe proposed algorithm optimally curtails DERs while guaranteeing the AC\nfeasibility of the network.",

However, these improvements\nare limited to PET scans with paired MRI information. In this work we employed\na diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) to infer T1-weighted-MRI (deep-MRI)\nimages from FDG-PET brain images. We then use the DPM-generated T1w-MRI to\nguide the PET reconstruction. The model was trained with brain FDG scans, and\ntested in datasets containing multiple levels of counts. Deep-MRI images\nappeared somewhat degraded than the acquired MRI images. Regarding PET image\nquality, volume of interest analysis in different brain regions showed that\nboth PET reconstructed images using the acquired and the deep-MRI images\nimproved image quality compared to OSEM. Same conclusions were found analysing\nthe decimated datasets. A subjective evaluation performed by two physicians\nconfirmed that OSEM scored consistently worse than the MRI-guided PET images\nand no significant differences were observed between the MRI-guided PET images.\nThis proof of concept shows that it is possible to infer DPM-based MRI imagery\nto guide the PET reconstruction, enabling the possibility of changing\nreconstruction parameters such as the strength of the prior on anatomically\nguided PET reconstruction in the absence of MRI.",

        "abstract": "Rapid advancements in medical image segmentation performance have been\nsignificantly driven by the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nand Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models follow the discriminative\npixel-wise classification learning paradigm and often have limited ability to\ngeneralize across diverse medical imaging datasets. In this manuscript, we\nintroduce Generative Medical Segmentation (GMS), a novel approach leveraging a\ngenerative model to perform image segmentation. Concretely, GMS employs a\nrobust pre-trained vision foundation model to extract latent representations\nfor images and corresponding ground truth masks, followed by a model that\nlearns a mapping function from the image to the mask in the latent space. Once\ntrained, the model generates an estimated segmentation mask using the\npre-trained vision foundation model to decode the predicted latent\nrepresentation back into the image space. The design of GMS leads to fewer\ntrainable parameters in the model which reduces the risk of overfitting and\nenhances its generalization capability. Our experimental analysis across five\npublic datasets in different medical imaging domains demonstrates GMS\noutperforms existing discriminative and generative segmentation models.\nFurthermore, GMS is able to generalize well across datasets from different\ncenters within the same imaging modality. Our experiments suggest GMS offers a\nscalable and effective solution for medical image segmentation.

        "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT)\nimaging is routinely used in cancer diagnosis and prognosis by providing\ncomplementary information. Automatically segmenting tumors in PET\/CT images can\nsignificantly improve examination efficiency. Traditional multi-modal\nsegmentation solutions mainly rely on concatenation operations for modality\nfusion, which fail to effectively model the non-linear dependencies between PET\nand CT modalities. Recent studies have investigated various approaches to\noptimize the fusion of modality-specific features for enhancing joint\nrepresentations. However, modality-specific encoders used in these methods\noperate independently, inadequately leveraging the synergistic relationships\ninherent in PET and CT modalities, for example, the complementarity between\nsemantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical\nAdaptive Interaction and Weighting Network termed H2ASeg to explore the\nintrinsic cross-modal correlations and transfer potential complementary\ninformation. Specifically, we design a Modality-Cooperative Spatial Attention\n(MCSA) module that performs intra- and inter-modal interactions globally and\nlocally. Additionally, a Target-Aware Modality Weighting (TAMW) module is\ndeveloped to highlight tumor-related features within multi-modal features,\nthereby refining tumor segmentation. By embedding these modules across\ndifferent layers, H2ASeg can hierarchically model cross-modal correlations,\nenabling a nuanced understanding of both semantic and structural tumor\nfeatures.

It is a matter of\ndeciding which of the elements in the mesh are part of the fluid domain, and to\ndefine a boundary - the free surface. Then, the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations are solved on the fluid domain and the particles' position is updated\nusing the resulting velocity vector. Our first contribution is to propose an\napproach to adapt the mesh with theoretical guarantees of quality: the mesh\ngeneration community has acquired a lot of experience and understanding about\nmesh adaptation approaches with guarantees of quality on the final mesh. We use\nhere a Delaunay refinement strategy, allowing to insert and remove nodes while\ngradually improving mesh quality. We show that this allows to create stable and\nsmooth free surface geometries. Our PFEM approach models the topological\nevolution of one fluid. It is nevertheless necessary to apply conditions on the\ndomain boundaries. When a boundary is a free surface, the flow on the other\nside is not modelled, it is represented by an external pressure. On the\nexternal free surface boundary, atmospheric pressure can be imposed.\nNevertheless, there may be internal free surfaces: the fluid can fully\nencapsulate cavities to form bubbles. The pressure required to maintain the\nvolume of those bubbles is a priori unknown. We propose a multi-point\nconstraint approach to enforce global incompressibility of those empty bubbles.\nThis approach allows to accurately model bubbly flows that involve two fluids\nwith large density differences, while only modelling the heavier fluid.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, individuals tend to engage in dialogues with Large Language Models,\nseeking answers to their questions. In times when such answers are readily\naccessible to anyone, the stimulation and preservation of human's cognitive\nabilities, as well as the assurance of maintaining good reasoning skills by\nhumans becomes crucial. This study addresses such needs by proposing hints\n(instead of final answers or before giving answers) as a viable solution. We\nintroduce a framework for the automatic hint generation for factoid questions,\nemploying it to construct TriviaHG, a novel large-scale dataset featuring\n160,230 hints corresponding to 16,645 questions from the TriviaQA dataset.\nAdditionally, we present an automatic evaluation method that measures the\nConvergence and Familiarity quality attributes of hints. To evaluate the\nTriviaHG dataset and the proposed evaluation method, we enlisted 10 individuals\nto annotate 2,791 hints and tasked 6 humans with answering questions using the\nprovided hints. The effectiveness of hints varied, with success rates of 96%,\n78%, and 36% for questions with easy, medium, and hard answers, respectively.\nMoreover, the proposed automatic evaluation methods showed a robust correlation\nwith annotators' results. Conclusively, the findings highlight three key\ninsights: the facilitative role of hints in resolving unknown questions, the\ndependence of hint quality on answer difficulty, and the feasibility of\nemploying automatic evaluation methods for hint assessment.",

        "abstract": "Useful materials are often statistically exceptional and they might be\noverlooked by AI models that attempt to describe all materials simultaneously.\nThese global models perform well for the majority of (useless) materials, but\nthey do not necessarily capture the useful ones. Subgroup discovery (SGD)\nidentifies rules describing subsets of materials (SGs) associated to\nexceptional values, e.g., high values, of a materials property of interest.\nThus, SGD can better capture exceptional materials compared to most widely used\nAI techniques. Previous works focused on the SG that maximizes an objective\nfunction that establishes one tradeoff between the size of the SG and the\nexceptionality of the distribution of property values in the SG. However, this\noptimization does not give a unique solution, but many SGs typically have\nsimilar objective-function values. Here, we identify a Pareto region of SGs\npresenting a multitude of size-exceptionality tradeoffs. The approach is\ndemonstrated by the learning of rules describing perovskites with high bulk\nmodulus. These rules are used to screen a large space of perovskites and to\nefficiently identify materials with bulk modulus up to 13 % higher than the\nhighest value of the training set.",

        "title": "DiffStyler: Diffusion-based Localized Image Style Transfer",
        "abstract": "Image style transfer aims to imbue digital imagery with the distinctive\nattributes of style targets, such as colors, brushstrokes, shapes, whilst\nconcurrently preserving the semantic integrity of the content. Despite the\nadvancements in arbitrary style transfer methods, a prevalent challenge remains\nthe delicate equilibrium between content semantics and style attributes. Recent\ndevelopments in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heralded\nunprecedented synthesis capabilities, albeit at the expense of relying on\nextensive and often imprecise textual descriptions to delineate artistic\nstyles. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces DiffStyler, a novel\napproach that facilitates efficient and precise arbitrary image style transfer.\nDiffStyler lies the utilization of a text-to-image Stable Diffusion model-based\nLoRA to encapsulate the essence of style targets. This approach, coupled with\nstrategic cross-LoRA feature and attention injection, guides the style transfer\nprocess. The foundation of our methodology is rooted in the observation that\nLoRA maintains the spatial feature consistency of UNet, a discovery that\nfurther inspired the development of a mask-wise style transfer technique. This\ntechnique employs masks extracted through a pre-trained FastSAM model,\nutilizing mask prompts to facilitate feature fusion during the denoising\nprocess, thereby enabling localized style transfer that preserves the original\nimage's unaffected regions. Moreover, our approach accommodates multiple style\ntargets through the use of corresponding masks. Through extensive\nexperimentation, we demonstrate that DiffStyler surpasses previous methods in\nachieving a more harmonious balance between content preservation and style\nintegration.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, several influential computational models and metrics have\nbeen proposed to predict how humans comprehend and process sentence. One\nparticularly promising approach is contextual semantic similarity. Inspired by\nthe attention algorithm in Transformer and human memory mechanisms, this study\nproposes an ``attention-aware'' approach for computing contextual semantic\nrelevance. This new approach takes into account the different contributions of\ncontextual parts and the expectation effect, allowing it to incorporate\ncontextual information fully. The attention-aware approach also facilitates the\nsimulation of existing reading models and evaluate them. The resulting\n``attention-aware'' metrics of semantic relevance can more accurately predict\nfixation durations in Chinese reading tasks recorded in an eye-tracking corpus\nthan those calculated by existing approaches. The study's findings further\nprovide strong support for the presence of semantic preview benefits in Chinese\nnaturalistic reading. Furthermore, the attention-aware metrics of semantic\nrelevance, being memory-based, possess high interpretability from both\nlinguistic and cognitive standpoints, making them a valuable computational tool\nfor modeling eye-movements in reading and further gaining insight into the\nprocess of language comprehension. Our approach underscores the potential of\nthese metrics to advance our comprehension of how humans understand and process\nlanguage, ultimately leading to a better understanding of language\ncomprehension and processing.",

Most current works resort to the whole observed point cloud for 6-Dof\ngrasp generation, ignoring the guidance information excavated from global\nsemantics, thus limiting high-quality grasp generation and real-time\nperformance. In this work, we show that the widely used heatmaps are\nunderestimated in the efficiency of 6-Dof grasp generation. Therefore, we\npropose an effective local grasp generator combined with grasp heatmaps as\nguidance, which infers in a global-to-local semantic-to-point way.\nSpecifically, Gaussian encoding and the grid-based strategy are applied to\npredict grasp heatmaps as guidance to aggregate local points into graspable\nregions and provide global semantic information. Further, a novel non-uniform\nanchor sampling mechanism is designed to improve grasp accuracy and diversity.\nBenefiting from the high-efficiency encoding in the image space and focusing on\npoints in local graspable regions, our framework can perform high-quality grasp\ndetection in real-time and achieve state-of-the-art results.

        "abstract": "Innovative synthetic approaches can yield new phases containing novel\nstructural and magnetic motifs. In this work, we show the synthesis and\nmagnetic characterization of three new and one previously reported layered\nphase in the K-Cu-Te-O(H) phase space using a tunable hydroflux technique. The\nhydroflux, with a roughly equal molar ratio of water and alkali hydroxide, is a\nhighly oxidizing, low melting solvent which can be used to isolate metastable\nphases unattainable through traditional solid state or flux techniques. The\nnewly synthesized phases, K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$, K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$\n$\\cdot$ H$_{2}$O, and K$_{6}$Cu$_{9}$Te$_{4}$O$_{24}$ $\\cdot$ 2 H$_{2}$O,\ncontain Cu$^{2+}$ within CuO$_{4}$ square planar plaquettes and TeO$_{6}$\noctahedra ordering to form structural honeycomb layers isolated by interlayer\nK$^{+}$ ions and H$_{2}$O molecules. We find the synthesized structures display\nvarying tilt sequences of the CuO$_{4}$ plaquettes, leading to distinct\nCu$^{2+}$ magnetic motifs on the structural honeycomb lattice and a range of\neffective magnetic dimensionalities. We find that K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$\n$\\cdot$ H$_{2}$O does not order and displays alternating chain Heisenberg\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior, while K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$ and\nK$_{6}$Cu$_{9}$Te$_{4}$O$_{24}$ $\\cdot$ 2 H$_{2}$O order antiferromagnetically\n(T$_{N}$ = 100 K and T$_{N}$ = 6.5 K respectively). The previously known phase,\nK$_{2}$CuTeO$_{4}$(OH)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ H$_{2}$O, we find contains structurally\nand magnetically one-dimensional CuO$_{4}$ plaquettes leading to uniform chain\nHeisenberg AFM behavior and shows no magnetic order down to T = 0.4 K. We\ndiscuss and highlight the usefulness of the hydroflux technique in novel\nsyntheses and the interesting magnetic motifs that arise in these particular\nphases.",

Central to JEP-KD is the inclusion of a generative network within the\nembedding layer, which enhances the video encoder's capacity for semantic\nfeature extraction and brings it into closer alignment with the audio features\nfrom a pre-trained ASR model's encoder. This approach aims to progressively\nreduce the performance gap between VSR and ASR. Moreover, a comprehensive\nmultimodal, multistage training regimen for the JEP-KD framework is\nestablished, bolstering the robustness and efficacy of the training process.\nExperiment results demonstrate that JEP-KD significantly improves the\nperformance of VSR models and demonstrates versatility across different VSR\nplatforms, indicating its potential for broader application within other\nmultimodal tasks.",

        "abstract": "Reservoir computers (RCs) are powerful machine learning architectures for\ntime series prediction. Recently, next generation reservoir computers (NGRCs)\nhave been introduced, offering distinct advantages over RCs, such as reduced\ncomputational expense and lower training data requirements. However, NGRCs have\ntheir own practical difficulties, including sensitivity to sampling time and\ntype of nonlinearities in the data. Here, we introduce a hybrid RC-NGRC\napproach for time series forecasting of dynamical systems. We show that our\nhybrid approach can produce accurate short term predictions and capture the\nlong term statistics of chaotic dynamical systems in situations where the RC\nand NGRC components alone are insufficient, e.g., due to constraints from\nlimited computational resources, sub-optimal hyperparameters, sparsely-sampled\ntraining data, etc. Under these conditions, we show for multiple model chaotic\nsystems that the hybrid RC-NGRC method with a small reservoir can achieve\nprediction performance approaching that of a traditional RC with a much larger\nreservoir, illustrating that the hybrid approach can offer significant gains in\ncomputational efficiency over traditional RCs while simultaneously addressing\nsome of the limitations of NGRCs. Our results suggest that hybrid RC-NGRC\napproach may be particularly beneficial in cases when computational efficiency\nis a high priority and an NGRC alone is not adequate.",

The neural architectures typically\nutilized in relevant literature are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with\nVision Transformers (ViTs) rarely employed. In order to address this gap, this\npaper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of relevant ViT architectures on\nillicit item detection in X-ray images. This study utilizes both Transformer\nand hybrid backbones, such as SWIN and NextViT, and detectors, such as DINO and\nRT-DETR. The results demonstrate the remarkable accuracy of the DINO\nTransformer detector in the low-data regime, the impressive real-time\nperformance of YOLOv8, and the effectiveness of the hybrid NextViT backbone.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates how machine learning (ML) models can predict hospital\nreadmissions for diabetic patients fairly and accurately across different\ndemographics (age, gender, race). We compared models like Deep Learning,\nGeneralized Linear Models, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Naive Bayes.\nGBM stood out with an F1-score of 84.3% and accuracy of 82.2%, accurately\npredicting readmissions across demographics. A fairness analysis was conducted\nacross all the models. GBM minimized disparities in predictions, achieving\nbalanced results across genders and races. It showed low False Discovery Rates\n(FDR) (6-7%) and False Positive Rates (FPR) (5%) for both genders.\nAdditionally, FDRs remained low for racial groups, such as African Americans\n(8%) and Asians (7%). Similarly, FPRs were consistent across age groups (4%)\nfor both patients under 40 and those above 40, indicating its precision and\nability to reduce bias. These findings emphasize the importance of choosing ML\nmodels carefully to ensure both accuracy and fairness for all patients. By\nshowcasing effectiveness of various models with fairness metrics, this study\npromotes personalized medicine and the need for fair ML algorithms in\nhealthcare. This can ultimately reduce disparities and improve outcomes for\ndiabetic patients of all backgrounds.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have revolutionized image synthesis, setting new benchmarks\nin quality and creativity. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by\nthe intensive computation required during the iterative denoising process.\nPost-training quantization (PTQ) presents a solution to accelerate sampling,\naibeit at the expense of sample quality, extremely in low-bit settings.\nAddressing this, our study introduces a unified Quantization Noise Correction\nScheme (QNCD), aimed at minishing quantization noise throughout the sampling\nprocess. We identify two primary quantization challenges: intra and inter\nquantization noise. Intra quantization noise, mainly exacerbated by embeddings\nin the resblock module, extends activation quantization ranges, increasing\ndisturbances in each single denosing step. Besides, inter quantization noise\nstems from cumulative quantization deviations across the entire denoising\nprocess, altering data distributions step-by-step. QNCD combats these through\nembedding-derived feature smoothing for eliminating intra quantization noise\nand an effective runtime noise estimatiation module for dynamicly filtering\ninter quantization noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\noutperforms previous quantization methods for diffusion models, achieving\nlossless results in W4A8 and W8A8 quantization settings on ImageNet (LDM-4).\nCode is available at: https:\/\/github.com\/huanpengchu\/QNCD",

To alleviate communication and computation overhead,\nparameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research\nadapted personalization methods to FedFM for better user preferences alignment.\nHowever, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time\ndistribution shifts in real-world applications, and conventional methods for\ntest-time distribution shifts in personalized FL are less effective for FedFM\ndue to their failure to adapt to complex distribution shift scenarios and the\nrequirement to train all parameters. To bridge this gap, we refine the setting\nin FedFM, termed test-time personalization, which aims to learn personalized\nfederated foundation models on clients while effectively handling test-time\ndistribution shifts simultaneously. To address challenges in this setting, we\nexplore a simple yet effective solution, a Federated Dual-Personalizing Adapter\n(FedDPA) architecture.

        "abstract": "Smart glasses are increasingly recognized as a key medium for augmented\nreality, offering a hands-free platform with integrated microphones and\nnon-ear-occluding loudspeakers to seamlessly mix virtual sound sources into the\nreal-world acoustic scene. To convincingly integrate virtual sound sources, the\nroom acoustic rendering of the virtual sources must match the real-world\nacoustics. Information about a user's acoustic environment however is typically\nnot available. This work uses a microphone array in a pair of smart glasses to\nblindly identify binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) from a few seconds of\nspeech in the real-world environment. The proposed method uses dereverberation\nand beamforming to generate a pseudo reference signal that is used by a\nmultichannel Wiener filter to estimate room impulse responses which are then\nconverted to BRIRs. The multichannel room impulse responses can be used to\nestimate room acoustic parameters which is shown to outperform baseline\nalgorithms in the estimation of reverberation time and direct-to-reverberant\nenergy ratio. Results from a listening experiment further indicate that the\nestimated BRIRs often reproduce the real-world room acoustics perceptually more\nconvincingly than measured BRIRs from other rooms of similar size.",

For typical utterance-level SER, our ENT\nmodels outperform state-of-the-art methods on IEMOCAP in low word error rate.\nExperiments on IEMOCAP and the latest speech emotion diarization dataset ZED\nalso demonstrate the superiority of fine-grained emotion modeling.

        "abstract": "Laparoscopic video tracking primarily focuses on two target types: surgical\ninstruments and anatomy. The former could be used for skill assessment, while\nthe latter is necessary for the projection of virtual overlays. Where\ninstrument and anatomy tracking have often been considered two separate\nproblems, in this paper, we propose a method for joint tracking of all\nstructures simultaneously. Based on a single 2D monocular video clip, we train\na neural field to represent a continuous spatiotemporal scene, used to create\n3D tracks of all surfaces visible in at least one frame. Due to the small size\nof instruments, they generally cover a small part of the image only, resulting\nin decreased tracking accuracy. Therefore, we propose enhanced class weighting\nto improve the instrument tracks. We evaluate tracking on video clips from\nlaparoscopic cholecystectomies, where we find mean tracking accuracies of 92.4%\nfor anatomical structures and 87.4% for instruments. Additionally, we assess\nthe quality of depth maps obtained from the method's scene reconstructions. We\nshow that these pseudo-depths have comparable quality to a state-of-the-art\npre-trained depth estimator. On laparoscopic videos in the SCARED dataset, the\nmethod predicts depth with an MAE of 2.9 mm and a relative error of 9.2%.

Single-view action recognition faces limitations due to its\nreliance on a single viewpoint. In contrast, multi-view approaches capture\ncomplementary information from various viewpoints for improved accuracy.\nRecently, event cameras have emerged as innovative bio-inspired sensors,\nleading to advancements in event-based action recognition. However, existing\nworks predominantly focus on single-view scenarios, leaving a gap in multi-view\nevent data exploitation, particularly in challenges like information deficit\nand semantic misalignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce HyperMV, a\nmulti-view event-based action recognition framework. HyperMV converts discrete\nevent data into frame-like representations and extracts view-related features\nusing a shared convolutional network. By treating segments as vertices and\nconstructing hyperedges using rule-based and KNN-based strategies, a multi-view\nhypergraph neural network that captures relationships across viewpoint and\ntemporal features is established. The vertex attention hypergraph propagation\nis also introduced for enhanced feature fusion.

These complex communities exhibit a surprising amount of\nfunctionally relevant diversity at all levels of taxonomic resolution,\npresenting a significant challenge for most modeling frameworks. A\nlong-standing hope of theoretical ecology is that some patterns might persist\ndespite community complexity -- or perhaps even emerge because of it. A deeper\nunderstanding of such \"emergent simplicity\" could enable new approaches for\npredicting the behaviors of the complex ecosystems in nature. However, most\nexamples described so far afford limited predictive power, as they focused on\nreproducibility rather than prediction. Here, we propose an\ninformation-theoretic framework for defining, nuancing and quantifying emergent\nsimplicity in empirical data based on the ability of simple models to predict\ncommunity-level functional properties. Applying this framework to two published\ndatasets, we demonstrate that the majority of properties measured across both\nexperiments exhibit robust evidence of emergent predictability: surprisingly,\nas community richness increases, simple compositional descriptions become more\npredictive. We show that this behavior is not typical within the standard\nmodeling frameworks of theoretical ecology, and argue that improving our\nability to predict and control natural microbial communities will require a\nshift of focus: away from complexity of _ecosystems_, and towards prediction\ncomplexity of _properties_ of ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "Automated molecular simulations are used extensively for predicting material\nproperties. Typically, these simulations exhibit two regimes: a dynamic\nequilibration part, followed by a steady state. For extracting observable\nproperties, the simulations must first reach a steady state so that\nthermodynamic averages can be taken. However, as equilibration depends on\nsimulation conditions, predicting the optimal number of simulation steps a\npriori is impossible. Here, we demonstrate the application of the Marginal\nStandard Error Rule (MSER) for automatically identifying the optimal truncation\npoint in Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. This novel automatic\nprocedure determines the point in which steady state is reached, ensuring that\nfigures-of-merits are extracted in an objective, accurate, and reproducible\nfashion. In the case of GCMC simulations of gas adsorption in metal-organic\nframeworks, we find that this methodology reduces the computational cost by up\nto 90%. As MSER statistics are independent of the simulation method that\ncreates the data, this library is, in principle, applicable to any time series\nanalysis in which equilibration truncation is required.

        "abstract": "In recent years, incomplete multi-view clustering, which studies the\nchallenging multi-view clustering problem on missing views, has received\ngrowing research interests. Although a series of methods have been proposed to\naddress this issue, the following problems still exist: 1) Almost all of the\nexisting methods are based on shallow models, which is difficult to obtain\ndiscriminative common representations. 2) These methods are generally sensitive\nto noise or outliers since the negative samples are treated equally as the\nimportant samples. In this paper, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view\nclustering network, called Cognitive Deep Incomplete Multi-view Clustering\nNetwork (CDIMC-net), to address these issues. Specifically, it captures the\nhigh-level features and local structure of each view by incorporating the\nview-specific deep encoders and graph embedding strategy into a framework.\nMoreover, based on the human cognition, i.e., learning from easy to hard, it\nintroduces a self-paced strategy to select the most confident samples for model\ntraining, which can reduce the negative influence of outliers. Experimental\nresults on several incomplete datasets show that CDIMC-net outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art incomplete multi-view clustering methods.",

This article presents a study on using\nsupervised neural network time series classification (NN TSC) to predict key\nattributes and tactics of swarming autonomous agents for military contexts.\nSpecifically, NN TSC is applied to infer two binary attributes - communication\nand proportional navigation - which combine to define four mutually exclusive\nswarm tactics. We identify a gap in literature on using NNs for swarm\nclassification and demonstrate the effectiveness of NN TSC in rapidly deducing\nintelligence about attacking swarms to inform counter-maneuvers. Through\nsimulated swarm-vs-swarm engagements, we evaluate NN TSC performance in terms\nof observation window requirements, noise robustness, and scalability to swarm\nsize. Key findings show NNs can predict swarm behaviors with 97% accuracy using\nshort observation windows of 20 time steps, while also demonstrating graceful\ndegradation down to 80% accuracy under 50% noise, as well as excellent\nscalability to swarm sizes from 10 to 100 agents.

Typically, such systems are described as\nslow-fast systems, where the slow dynamics result from a hyperbolic slow\nmanifold that guides the movement of the system trajectories. Recently, we have\nprovided an alternative description in which the slow dynamics result from a\nnon-hyperbolic and Lyapunov-unstable attracting sets from connected dynamical\nghosts that form a closed orbit (termed ghost cycles). Here we investigate the\nresponse properties of both type of systems to external forcing. Using the\nclassical Van-der-Pol oscillator and two modified versions of this model that\ncorrespond to a 1-ghost and a 2-ghost cycle, respectively, we find that ghost\ncycles are characterized by significant increase especially in the 1:1\nentrainment regions as demonstrated by the corresponding Arnold tongues and\nexhibit richer dynamics (bursting, chaos) in contrast to the classical\nslow-fast system. Phase plane analysis reveals that these features result from\nthe continuous remodeling of the attractor landscape of the ghost cycles models\ncharacteristic for non-autonomous systems, whereas the attractor landscape of\nthe corresponding slow-fast system remains qualitatively unaltered. We propose\nthat systems containing ghost cycles display increased flexibility and\nresponsiveness to continuous environmental changes.",

        "abstract": "Remote sensing image classification forms the foundation of various\nunderstanding tasks, serving a crucial function in remote sensing image\ninterpretation. The recent advancements of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nand Transformers have markedly enhanced classification accuracy. Nonetheless,\nremote sensing scene classification remains a significant challenge, especially\ngiven the complexity and diversity of remote sensing scenarios and the\nvariability of spatiotemporal resolutions. The capacity for whole-image\nunderstanding can provide more precise semantic cues for scene discrimination.\nIn this paper, we introduce RSMamba, a novel architecture for remote sensing\nimage classification. RSMamba is based on the State Space Model (SSM) and\nincorporates an efficient, hardware-aware design known as the Mamba. It\nintegrates the advantages of both a global receptive field and linear modeling\ncomplexity. To overcome the limitation of the vanilla Mamba, which can only\nmodel causal sequences and is not adaptable to two-dimensional image data, we\npropose a dynamic multi-path activation mechanism to augment Mamba's capacity\nto model non-causal data. Notably, RSMamba maintains the inherent modeling\nmechanism of the vanilla Mamba, yet exhibits superior performance across\nmultiple remote sensing image classification datasets. This indicates that\nRSMamba holds significant potential to function as the backbone of future\nvisual foundation models.

        "abstract": "Text-to-image generation systems have emerged as revolutionary tools in the\nrealm of artistic creation, offering unprecedented ease in transforming textual\nprompts into visual art. However, the efficacy of these systems is intricately\nlinked to the quality of user-provided prompts, which often poses a challenge\nto users unfamiliar with prompt crafting. This paper addresses this challenge\nby leveraging user reformulation data from interaction logs to develop an\nautomatic prompt reformulation model. Our in-depth analysis of these logs\nreveals that user prompt reformulation is heavily dependent on the individual\nuser's capability, resulting in significant variance in the quality of\nreformulation pairs. To effectively use this data for training, we introduce\nthe Capability-aware Prompt Reformulation (CAPR) framework. CAPR innovatively\nintegrates user capability into the reformulation process through two key\ncomponents: the Conditional Reformulation Model (CRM) and Configurable\nCapability Features (CCF). CRM reformulates prompts according to a specified\nuser capability, as represented by CCF. The CCF, in turn, offers the\nflexibility to tune and guide the CRM's behavior. This enables CAPR to\neffectively learn diverse reformulation strategies across various user\ncapacities and to simulate high-capability user reformulation during inference.\nExtensive experiments on standard text-to-image generation benchmarks showcase\nCAPR's superior performance over existing baselines and its remarkable\nrobustness on unseen systems. Furthermore, comprehensive analyses validate the\neffectiveness of different components. CAPR can facilitate user-friendly\ninteraction with text-to-image systems and make advanced artistic creation more\nachievable for a broader range of users.",

We\nprovide simple expressions for the energy stored in the battery, the maximum\namount of work which can be extracted, both the instantaneous and the average\npowers, and the relevant charging times.

        "abstract": "Head pose estimation has become a crucial area of research in computer vision\ngiven its usefulness in a wide range of applications, including robotics,\nsurveillance, or driver attention monitoring. One of the most difficult\nchallenges in this field is managing head occlusions that frequently take place\nin real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient\nframework that is robust in real world head occlusion scenarios. In particular,\nwe propose an unsupervised latent embedding clustering with regression and\nclassification components for each pose angle. The model optimizes latent\nfeature representations for occluded and non-occluded images through a\nclustering term while improving fine-grained angle predictions. Experimental\nevaluation on in-the-wild head pose benchmark datasets reveal competitive\nperformance in comparison to state-of-the-art methodologies with the advantage\nof having a significant data reduction. We observe a substantial improvement in\noccluded head pose estimation. Also, an ablation study is conducted to\nascertain the impact of the clustering term within our proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "Medical image segmentation of anatomical structures and pathology is crucial\nin modern clinical diagnosis, disease study, and treatment planning. To date,\ngreat progress has been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques,\nbut most methods still lack data efficiency, generalizability, and\ninteractability. Consequently, the development of new, precise segmentation\nmethods that demand fewer labeled datasets is of utmost importance in medical\nimage analysis. Recently, the emergence of foundation models, such as CLIP and\nSegment-Anything-Model (SAM), with comprehensive cross-domain representation\nopened the door for interactive and universal image segmentation. However,\nexploration of these models for data-efficient medical image segmentation is\nstill limited, but is highly necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework, called MedCLIP-SAM that combines CLIP and SAM models to generate\nsegmentation of clinical scans using text prompts in both zero-shot and weakly\nsupervised settings. To achieve this, we employed a new Decoupled Hard Negative\nNoise Contrastive Estimation (DHN-NCE) loss to fine-tune the BiomedCLIP model\nand the recent gScoreCAM to generate prompts to obtain segmentation masks from\nSAM in a zero-shot setting. Additionally, we explored the use of zero-shot\nsegmentation labels in a weakly supervised paradigm to improve the segmentation\nquality further. By extensively testing three diverse segmentation tasks and\nmedical image modalities (breast tumor ultrasound, brain tumor MRI, and lung\nX-ray), our proposed framework has demonstrated excellent accuracy.

        "abstract": "Fine-tuning a pre-trained model, such as Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT), has been proven to be an effective\nmethod for solving many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due\nto the large number of parameters in many state-of-the-art NLP models,\nincluding BERT, the process of fine-tuning is computationally expensive. One\nattractive solution to this issue is parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which\ninvolves modifying only a minimal segment of the model while keeping the\nremainder unchanged. Yet, it remains unclear which segment of the BERT model is\ncrucial for fine-tuning. In this paper, we first analyze different components\nin the BERT model to pinpoint which one undergoes the most significant changes\nafter fine-tuning. We find that output LayerNorm changes more than any other\ncomponents when fine-tuned for different General Language Understanding\nEvaluation (GLUE) tasks. Then we show that only fine-tuning the LayerNorm can\nreach comparable, or in some cases better, performance to full fine-tuning and\nother parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Moreover, we use Fisher\ninformation to determine the most critical subset of LayerNorm and demonstrate\nthat many NLP tasks in the GLUE benchmark can be solved by fine-tuning only a\nsmall portion of LayerNorm with negligible performance degradation.",
